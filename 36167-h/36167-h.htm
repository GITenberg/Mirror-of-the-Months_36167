<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>As the first few pages of this little
volume will sufficiently explain its purport,
the reader would not have been troubled
with any prefatory remarks, but that, since
its commencement, two existing works have
been pointed out to me, the plans of which
are, in one respect, similar to mine: I allude
to the Natural History of the Year,
by the late Dr. Aikin and his Son; and
The Months, by Mr. Leigh Hunt.</p>

<p>I will not affect any obligations to these
agreeable little works, (I mean as a writer);
because I feel none; and I mention them
here, only to add, that if, on perusing them,
either, or both united, had seemed to su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>persede
what I proposed to myself in mine,
I should immediately have abandoned my
intention of writing it. But the above-named
works, in the first place, relate to
country matters exclusively. In the next
place, the first of them details those matters
in the form of a dry calendar, professedly
made up from other calendars
which previously existed, and <i>not</i> from
actual observation; and the second merely
throws gleams of its writer’s agreeable genius
over such of those matters as are most
susceptible of that treatment: while both
occupy no little portion of their space by
quotations, sufficiently appropriate no doubt,
but from poets whose works are in everybody’s
hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mirror of the Months</span>, therefore,
does not interfere with the abovenamed
works, nor do they with it. It is in substance,
though certainly not in form, a
Calendar of the various events and ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>pearances
connected with a Country and a
London life, during each successive Month
of the Year. And it endeavours to impress
upon the memory such of its information
as seems best worth retaining, by either
placing it in a <i>picturesque</i> point of view,
or by connecting it with some association,
often purely accidental, and not seldom
extravagant perhaps, but not the less likely
to answer its end, if it succeed in changing
mere dry information into amusement.</p>

<p>I may perhaps be allowed to add, in
extenuation of the errors and deficiencies
of this little volume, that it has been
written entirely from the personal observations
of one who uses no note-book but
that which Nature writes for him in the
tablets of his memory; and that when
printed books have been turned to at all, it
has only been with a view to solve any doubt
that he might feel, as to the exact period
of any particular event or appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
It is also proper to mention, that the four
first Months have appeared in a periodical
work. In fact, it was the favourable reception
they met with there which induced
the careful re-writing of them, and the appearance
of the whole under their present
form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">{1}</a></span></p>

<p id="begin">MIRROR OF THE MONTHS.</p>

<h2><a name="JANUARY" id="JANUARY"></a>JANUARY.</h2>

<p>Those “Cynthias of a minute,” the Months,
fleet past us so swiftly, that though we never
mistake them while they are present with us,
yet the moment any one of them is gone by, we
begin to blend the recollection of its features
with those of the one which preceded it, or that
which has taken its place, and thus confuse them
together till we know not “which is which.”
And then, to mend the matter, when the whole
of them have danced their graceful round, hand
in hand, before us, not being able to think of
either separately, we unite them all together in
our imagination, and call them the Past Year;
as we gather flowers into a bunch, and call them
a bouquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
Now this should not be. Each one of the
sweet sisterhood has features sufficiently marked
and distinct to entitle her to a place and a name;
and if we mistake these features, and attribute
those of any one to any other, it is because we
look at them with a cold and uninterested, and
therefore an inobservant regard. The lover of
Julie could trace fifty minute particulars which
were wanting in the portrait of his mistress;
though to any one else it would have appeared a
likeness: for, to common observers, “a likeness”
means merely a something which is not so absolutely
<i>un</i>like but what it is capable of calling
up the idea of the original, to those who are intimately
acquainted with it.</p>

<p>Now, I have been for a long while past accustomed
to feel towards the common portraits
of the Months, of which so many are extant,
what St. Preux did towards that of his mistress:
all I could ever discover in them was the particulars
in which they were <i>not</i> like. Still I had
never ventured to ask the favour of either of
them to sit to me for her picture; having seen
that it was the very nature of them to be for
ever changing, and that, therefore, to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to <i>fix</i> them, would be to trace the outline of a
sound, or give the colour of a perfume.</p>

<p>At length, however, my unwearied attendance
on them, in their yearly passage past me, and
the assiduous court that I have always paid to
each and all of their charms, has met with its
reward: for there is this especial difference between
them and all other mistresses whatever,
that, so far from being jealous of each other,
their sole ground of complaint against their
lovers is, that they do not pay equal devotion to
each in her turn; the blooming <span class="smcap">May</span> and the
blushing <span class="smcap">June</span> disdain the vows of those votaries
who have not previously wept at the feet
of the weeping <span class="smcap">April</span>, or sighed in unison with
the sad breath of <span class="smcap">March</span>. And it is the same
with all the rest. They present a sweet emblem
of the <i>ideal</i> of a happy and united human family;
to each member of which the best proof
you can offer that you are worthy of <i>her</i> love, is,
that you have gained that of her sisters; and to
whom the best evidence you can give of being
able to love either worthily, is, that you love all.
This, I say, has been the kind of court that I
have paid to the Months&mdash;loving each in all,
and all in each. And my reward (in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
that of the love itself&mdash;which is a “virtue,” and
therefore “its own reward”) has been that each
has condescended to watch over and instruct me,
while I wrote down the particulars of her brief
but immortal life&mdash;immortal, because ever renewed,
and bearing the seeds of its renewal
within itself.</p>

<p>These instructions, however, were accompanied
by certain conditions, without complying with
which I am not permitted to make the results
available to any one but myself. For my own
private satisfaction I have liberty to personify
the objects of my admiration under any form I
please; but if I speak of them to others, they
insist on being treated merely as portions or
periods of their beautiful parent the <span class="smcap">Year</span>, as
<i>she</i> is a portion of <span class="smcap">Time</span>, the great parent of all
things; and that the facts and events I may
have to refer to, shall not be essentially connected
with <i>them</i>, but merely be considered as taking
place during the period of their sojourn on the
earth respectively.</p>

<p>I confess that this condition seems to savour a
little of the fastidious, not to say the affected.
And, what is still more certain, it cuts me off from
a most fertile source of the poetical and the pic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>turesque.
I will frankly add, however, that I
am not without my suspicions that this latter
may have been the very reason why this condition
was imposed upon me; for I am by no means
certain that, if I had been left to myself, I
should not have substituted cold abstractions
and unintelligible fictions (or what would have
seemed such to others), in the place of that
simple <i>information</i> which it is my chief object to
convey.</p>

<p>Laying aside, then, if I can, all ornamental
figures of speech, I shall proceed to place before
the reader, in plain prose, the principal events
which happen, in the two worlds of Nature and
of Art, during the life and reign of each month;
beginning with the nominal beginning of the
dynasty, and continuing to present, on the birthday
of each member of it, a record of the beauties
which she brings in her train, and the good deeds
which she either inspires or performs.</p>

<p>Hail! then, hail to thee, <span class="smcap">January</span>!&mdash;all hail!
cold and wintry as thou art, if it be but in virtue
of thy first day. <span class="smcap">The day</span>, as the French call
it, par excellence; “Le jour de l’an.” Come
about me, all ye little schoolboys, that have
escaped from the unnatural thraldom of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
taskwork&mdash;come crowding about me, with your
untamed hearts shouting in your unmodulated
voices, and your happy spirits dancing an untaught
measure in your eyes! Come, and help
me to speak the praises of New Year’s Day!&mdash;<i>your</i>
day&mdash;one of the three which have, of late,
become yours almost exclusively, and which have
bettered you, and been bettered themselves, by
the change. Christmas-day, which <i>was</i>; New-year’s-day,
which <i>is</i>; and Twelfth-day, which
<i>is to be</i>; let us compel them all three into our
presence&mdash;with a whisk of our imaginative wand
convert them into one, as the conjurer does his
three glittering balls&mdash;and then enjoy them all together,&mdash;with
their dressings, and coachings, and
visitings, and greetings, and gifts, and “many
happy returns”&mdash;with their plum-puddings, and
mince-pies, and twelfth cakes, and neguses&mdash;with
their forfeits, and fortune-tellings, and blind-man’s-buffs,
and snap-dragons, and sittings up to
supper&mdash;with their pantomimes, and panoramas,
and new penknives, and pastrycooks’ shops&mdash;in
short, with their endless round of ever new
nothings, the absence of a relish for which is
but ill supplied, in after life, by that feverish
hungering and thirsting after excitement, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
usurp without filling its place. Oh! that I
might enjoy those nothings once again in fact, as
I can in fancy! But I fear the wish is worse
than an idle one; for it not only may not be,
but it ought not to be. “We cannot have our
cake and eat it too,” as the vulgar somewhat
vulgarly, but not the less shrewdly, express it.
And this is as it should be; for if we could,
it would neither be worth the eating nor the
having.</p>

<p>If the reader complains that this is not the
sober style which I just now promised to maintain,
I cannot help it. Besides, it was my subject
that spoke then, not myself; and it spoke to
those who are too happy to be wise, and to whom,
therefore, if it were to speak wisely, it might as
well not speak at all. Let them alone for awhile,
and they will grow too wise to be happy; and
then they may be disposed and at leisure to
listen to reason.</p>

<p>In sober sadness, then, if the reader so wills
it, and after the approved manner of modern
moral discourses, the subject before us may be
regarded under three distinct points of view;
namely, January in London&mdash;January in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
country&mdash;and January in general. And first, of
the first.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;but before I proceed further, let me
bespeak the reader’s indulgence at least, if not
his favour, towards this everlasting monosyllable,
“Now,” to which my betters have, from time to
time, been so much indebted, and on which I
shall be compelled to place so much dependence
in this my present undertaking. It is the pass
word, the “open sesame,” that must remove
from before me all lets and impediments; it is
the charm that will alternately put to silence my
imagination when it may be disposed to infringe
on the office of my memory, and awaken my
memory when it is inclined to sleep; in fact, it
is a monosyllable of infinite avail, and for which,
on this as on many other occasions, no substitute
can be found in our own or any other language;
and if I approve, above all other proverbs, that
which says, “There’s nothing like the time
present,” it is partly because “the time present”
is but a periphrasis for <span class="smcap">Now</span>!</p>

<p>Now, then, the cloudy canopy of sea-coal
smoke that hangs over London, and crowns her
queen of capitals, floats thick and threefold; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
fires and feastings are rife, and every body is
either “out” or “at home,” every night.</p>

<p>Now schoolboys don’t know what to do with
themselves till dinner-time; for the good old
days of frost and snow, and fairs on the Thames,
and furred gloves, and skaiting on the canals,
and sliding on the kennels, are gone by; and for
any thing in the shape of winter one might as
well live in Italy at once!</p>

<p>Now, on the evening of Twelfth-day, mischievous
maid-servants pin elderly people together
at the windows of pastry-cooks’ shops,
thinking them “weeds that have no business
there.”</p>

<p>Now, if a frosty day or two does happen to
pay us a flying visit, on its way home to the
North Pole, how the little boys make slides on
the pathways, for lack of ponds, and, it may
be, trip up an occasional housekeeper just as he
steps out of his own door; who forthwith vows
vengeance, in the shape of ashes, on all the slides
in his neighbourhood; not, doubtless, out of
vexation at his own mishap, and revenge against
the petty perpetrators of it, but purely to avert
the like from others!</p>

<p>Now, Bond Street begins to be conscious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
carriages; two or three people are occasionally
seen wandering through the Western Bazaar;
and the Soho Ditto is so thronged, that Mr.
Trotter begins to think of issuing another decree
against the inroads of single gentlemen.</p>

<p>Now, linen drapers begin to “sell off” their
stock at “fifty per cent. under prime cost,” and
continue so doing all the rest of the year; every
article of which will be found, on inspection, to
be of “the last new pattern,” and to have been
“only had in that morning!”</p>

<p>Now, oranges are eaten in the dress-circle of
the great theatres, and inquiries are propounded
there, whether “that gentleman in black” (meaning
Hamlet) “is Harlequin?” And laughs, and
“La! Mammas!” resound thence to the remotest
corners of the house; and “the gods” make
merry during the play, in order that they may
be at leisure to listen to the pantomime; and
Mr. Farley is consequently in his glory, and Mr.
Grimaldi is a great man; as, indeed, when is he
not?</p>

<p>Now, newspapers teem with twice-ten-times-told
tales of haunted houses, and great sea-snakes,
and mermaids; and a murder is worth a
Jew’s eye to them; for “the House does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
meet for the despatch of business till the fifth of
February.” And great and grievous are the lamentations
that are heard in the said newspapers,
over the lateness of the London season, and its
detrimental effects on the interests of the metropolis;
but they forget to add&mdash;“erratum&mdash;for
<i>metropolis</i>, read <i>newspapers</i>.”</p>

<p>Now, Moore’s Almanack holds “sole sovereign
sway and mastery” among the readers of that
class of literature; for there has not yet been time
to nullify any of its predictions; not even that
which says, “we may expect some frost and
snow about this period.”</p>

<p>Finally, now periodical works put on their
best attire; the old ones expressing their determination
to become new, and the new ones to
become old; and each makes a point of putting
forth the first of some pleasant series of essays
(such as this, for example!), which cannot fail
to fix the most fugitive of readers, and make
him her own for another twelve months at least.</p>

<p>Let us now repair to the country. “The
country in January” has but a dreary sound, to
those who go into “the country” only that they
may not be seen “in town.” But to those who
seek the country for the same reason that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
seek London, namely, for the good that is to be
found there, the one has at least as many attractions
as the other, at any given period of the
year. Let me add, however, that if there <i>is</i> a
particular period when the country puts forth
fewer of her attractions than at any other, it is
this; probably to try who are her real lovers,
and who are only false flatterers, and to treat
them accordingly. And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, the trees, denuded of their gay attire,
spread forth their thousand branches against the
gray sky, and present as endless a variety of
form and feature for study and observation,
as they did when dressed in all the flaunting
fashions of midsummer. Now, too, their voices
are silent, and their forms are motionless, even
when the wind is among them; so that the
low plaintive piping of the robin-redbreast can
be heard, and his hiding-place detected by the
sound of his slim feet alighting on the fallen
leaves. Or now, grown bolder as the skies
become more inclement, he flits before you from
twig to twig silently, like a winged thought;
or like the brown and crimson leaf of a cherry-tree,
blown about by the wind; or perches
himself by your side, and looks sidelong in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
your face, pertly, and yet imploringly,&mdash;as much
as to say, “though I do need your aid just
now, and would condescend to accept a crum
from your hand, yet I’m still your betters, for
I’m still a bird.”</p>

<p>Now, one of the most beautiful sights on which
the eye can open occasionally presents itself:
we saw the shades of evening fall upon a waste
expanse of brown earth, shorn hedge-rows, bare
branches, and miry roads, interspersed here and
there with a patch of dull melancholy green.
But when we are awakened by the late dawning
of the morning, and think to look forth upon the
same, what a bright pomp greets us! What a
white pageantry! It is as if the fleecy clouds
that float about the sun at midsummer had descended
upon the earth, and clothed it in their
beauty! Every object we look upon is strange
and yet familiar to us&mdash;“another, yet the
same!” And the whole affects us like a vision of
the night, which we are half conscious <i>is</i> a
vision: we know that it is <i>there</i>, and yet we
know not how long it may remain there, since a
motion may change it, or a breath melt it away.
And what a mysterious stillness reigns over all!
A white silence! Even the “clouted shoon” of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
the early peasant is not heard; and the robin,
as he hops from twig to twig with undecided
wing, and shakes down a feathery shower as he
goes, hushes his low whistle in wonder at the
unaccustomed scene!</p>

<p>Now, the labour of the husbandman is, for
once in the year, at a stand; and he haunts the
alehouse fire, or lolls listlessly over the half-door
of the village smithy, and watches the progress
of the labour which he unconsciously envies;
tasting for once in his life (without knowing it)
the bitterness of that <i>ennui</i> which he begrudges
to his betters.</p>

<p>Now, melancholy-looking men wander “by
twos and threes” through market-towns, with
their faces as blue as the aprons that are twisted
round their waists; their ineffectual rakes resting
on their shoulders, and a withered cabbage
hoisted upon a pole; and sing out their doleful
petition of “Pray remember the poor gardeners,
who can get no work!”</p>

<p>Now, the passengers outside the Cheltenham
night-coach look wistfully at the Witney blanket-mills
as they pass, and meditate on the merits of
a warm bed.</p>

<p>Now, people of fashion, who cannot think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
coming to their homes in town so early in the
season, and will not think of remaining at their
homes in the country so late, seek out spots on the
seashore which have the merit of being neither
town <i>nor</i> country, and practise patience there (as
Timon of Athens did), en attendant the London
winter, which is ordered to commence about the
first week in spring, and end at midsummer!</p>

<p>But we are forgetting the garden all this
while; which must not be; for Nature does not.
Though the gardener can find little to do in it,
<i>she</i> is ever at work there, and ever with a wise
hand, and graceful as wise. The wintry winds
of December having shaken down the last lingering
leaves from the trees, the final labour of
the gardener was employed in making all trim
and clean; in turning up the dark earth, to give
it air; pruning off the superfluous produce of
summer; and gathering away the worn-out attire
that the perennial flowers leave behind them,
when they sink into the earth to seek their winter
home, as Harlequin and Columbine, in the pantomimes,
sometimes slip down through a trapdoor,
and cheat their silly pursuers by leaving
their vacant dresses standing erect behind them.</p>

<p>All being left trim and orderly for the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
on of the new year. Now (to resume our friendly
monosyllable) all the processes of nature for the
renewal of her favoured race, the flowers, may
be more aptly observed than at any other period.
Still, therefore, however desolate a scene the
garden may present to the <i>general</i> gaze, a particular
examination of it is full of interest, and
interest that is not the less valuable for its depending
chiefly on the imagination.</p>

<p>Now, the bloom-buds of the fruit trees, which
the late leaves of autumn had concealed from
the view, stand confessed, upon the otherwise
bare branches, and, dressed in their patent wind-and-water-proof
coats, brave the utmost severity
of the season,&mdash;their hard unpromising outsides,
compared with the forms of beauty which they
contain, reminding us of their friends the butterflies
when in the chrysalis state.</p>

<p>Now, the perennials, having slipped off their
summer robes, and retired to their subterranean
sleeping-rooms, just permit the tops of their
naked heads to peep above the ground, to warn
the labourer from disturbing their annual repose.</p>

<p>Now, the smooth-leaved and tender-stemmed
Rose of China hangs its pale, scentless, artificial-looking
flowers upon the cheek of Winter; re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>minding
us of the last faint bloom upon the face
of a fading beauty, or the hectic of disease on
that of a dying one; and a few chrysanthemums
still linger, the wreck of the past year,&mdash;their
various coloured stars looking like faded imitations
of the gay, glaring China-aster.</p>

<p>Now, too,&mdash;first evidences of the revivifying
principle of the new-born year&mdash;for all that we
have hitherto noticed are but lingering remnants
of the old&mdash;Now, the golden and blue crocuses
peep up their pointed coronals from amidst their
guarding palisades of green and gray leaves, that
they may be ready to come forth at the call of
the first February sun that looks warmly upon
them; and perchance one here and there, bolder
than the rest, has started fairly out of the earth
already, and half opened her trim form, pretending
to have mistaken the true time; as a
forward school-miss will occasionally be seen
coquetting with a smart cornet, before she has
been regularly produced,&mdash;as if she did not
know that there was “any harm in it.”</p>

<p>We are now to consider the pretensions of
January in general.</p>

<p>When the palm of merit is to be awarded
among the Months, it is usual to assign it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
May by acclamation. But if the claim depends
on the sum of delight which each witnesses or
brings with her, I doubt if January should not
bear the bell from her more blooming sister, if
it were only in virtue of her share in the aforenamed
festivities of the Christmas Holidays.
And then, what a happy influence does she not
exercise on all the rest of the Year, by the family
meetings she brings about, and by the kindling
and renewing of the social affections that grow
out of, and are chiefly dependent on these. And
what sweet remembrances and associations does
she not scatter before her, through all the time
to come, by her gifts&mdash;the “new year’s gifts!”
<i>Christmas-boxes</i> (as they are called) are but
sordid boons in comparison of these; they are
mere money paid for mere services rendered or
expected; wages for work done and performed;
barterings of value for value; offerings of the
pocket to the pocket. But new year’s gifts are
offerings of the affections to the affections&mdash;of
the heart to the heart. The value of the first
depends purely on themselves; and the gratitude
(such as it is) which they call forth, is measured
by the gross amount of that value. But the
others owe their value to the wishes and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>tentions
of the giver; and the gratitude <i>they</i> call
forth springs from the affections of the receiver.</p>

<p>And then, who can see a New Year open upon
him, without being better for the prospect&mdash;without
making sundry wise reflections (for <i>any</i>
reflections on this subject <i>must</i> be comparatively
wise ones) on the step he is about to take towards
the goal of his being? Every first of January
that we arrive at, is an imaginary mile-stone on
the turnpike track of human life; at once a
resting-place for thought and meditation, and a
starting point for fresh exertion in the performance
of our journey. The man who does not at
least <i>propose to himself</i> to be better <i>this</i> year
than he was last, must be either very good or
very bad indeed! And only to <i>propose</i> to be
better, is something; if nothing else it is an
acknowledgment of our <i>need</i> to be so,&mdash;which is
the first step towards amendment. But in fact,
to propose to oneself to do well, is in some sort
to <i>do</i> well, positively; for there is no such thing
as a stationary point in human endeavours; he
who is not worse to-day than he was yesterday,
is better; and he who is not better, is worse.</p>

<p>The very name of January, from Janus, two-faced,
“looking before and after,” indicates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
reflective propensities which she encourages, and
which when duly exercised cannot fail to lead to
good.</p>

<p>And then January is the youngest of the
yearly brood, and therefore <i>prima facie</i> the
best; for I protest most strenuously against the
comparative age which Chaucer (I think) has
assigned to this month by implication, when he
compares an old husband and a young wife to
“January and June.” These poets will sacrifice
any thing to alliteration, even abstract truth. I
am sorry to say this of Chaucer, whose poetry
is more of “a true thing” than that of any other,
always excepting Mr. Crabbe’s, which is too
much of a true thing. And nobody knew better
than Chaucer the respective merits of the Months,
and the peculiar qualities and characteristics
which appertain to each. But, I repeat, alliteration
is the Scylla and Charybdis united of
all who embark on the perilous ocean of poetry;
and that Chaucer himself chose occasionally to
“listen to the voice of the charmer, charmed she
never so <i>un</i>wisely,” the above example affords
sufficient proof. I am afraid poets themselves
are too self-opiniated people to make it worth
while for me to warn <i>them</i> on this point; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
hereby pray all prose writers pertinaciously to
avoid so pernicious a practice. This, however,
by the by.</p>

<p>I need scarcely accumulate other arguments
and examples to show that my favourite January
deserves to rank first among the Months in merit,
as she does in place. But lest doubters should
still remain, I will add, ask the makers-out of
annual accounts whether any month can compare
with January, since then they may begin to <i>hope</i>
for a settlement, and may even in some cases
venture to <i>ask</i> for it; which latter is a comfort
that has been denied them during all the rest of
the year; besides its being a remote step towards
the said settlement. And on the other hand, ask
the contractors of annual accounts whether January
is not the best of all possible months, since
then they may begin to <i>order</i> afresh, with the
prospect of a whole year’s impunity. The answers
to these two questions must of course
decide the point, since the two classes of persons
to whom they are addressed include the whole
adult(erated) population of these commercial
realms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"><br />{23}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="FEBRUARY" id="FEBRUARY"></a>FEBRUARY.</h2>

<p>Some one has said of the Scotch novels, that
that is the best which we happen to have perused
last. It is thus that I estimate the relative
value and virtue of the Months. The one which
happens to be present with me is sure to be that
one which I happen to like better than any of
the others. I lately insisted on the supremacy
of January on various accounts. Now I have a
similar claim to put in in favour of the next in
succession. And it shall go hard but I will
prove, to the entire satisfaction of all whom it
may concern, that each in her turn is, beyond
comparison, the “wisest, virtuousest, discreetest,
best.” Indeed I doubt whether, on consideration,
any one (but a Scotch philosopher) will be
inclined to dispute the truth of this, even as a
logical proposition, much less as a sentiment.
The time present is the best of all possible times,
<i>because</i> it is present&mdash;because it <i>is</i>&mdash;because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
is something; whereas all other times are nothing.
The time present, therefore, is essentially
better than any other time, in the proportion of
something to nothing. I hope this be logic;
or metaphysics at the least. If the reader determines
otherwise, “he may kill the next Percy
himself!” In the mean time (and <i>that</i>, by the
by, is the best time next to the present, in
virtue of its skill in connecting together two
refractory periods)&mdash;in the mean time, let us
search for another and a better reason why every
one of the Months is, in its turn, the best.
The cleverest Scotch philosopher that ever lived
has said, in a memoir of his own life, that a
man had better be born with a disposition to
look on the bright side of things, than to an
estate of ten thousand a year. He might have
gone further, and said that the disposition to
which he alludes is worth almost as much to
a man as being compelled and able to earn an
honest livelihood by the sweat of his brow! Nay,
he might almost have asserted that, with such a
disposition, a man may chance to be happy even
though he be born to an estate of <i>twenty</i> thousand
a year! But I, not being (thank my stars!)
a Scotch or any other philosopher, will venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
to go still farther, and say, that to be able to
look at things <i>as they are</i>, is best of all. To
him who can do this, all is as it should be&mdash;all
things work together for good&mdash;whatever is, is
right. To him who can do this, the present
time is all-sufficient, or rather it is all in all;
for if he cannot enjoy any other, it is because no
other is susceptible of being enjoyed, except
through the medium of the present.</p>

<p>From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a
step. Consequently, from the ridiculous to the
sublime must be about the same distance. In
other words, the transition from metaphysics to
love is easy; as Mr. Coleridge’s writings can
amply testify. Hail! then, February! month
and mother of Love! Not that love which requires
the sun of midsummer to foster it into
life; and is so restless and fugitive that nothing
can hold it but bands made of bright eye-beams;
and so dainty that it must be fed on
rose-leaves; and so proud and fantastical that
bowers of jasmine and honeysuckle are not good
enough for it to dwell in, or the green turf soft
enough for its feet to press, but it must sit beneath
silken canopies, and tread on Turkey
carpets, and breathe the breath of pastiles; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
so chilly that it must pass all its nights within a
gentle bosom, or it dies. Not <i>this</i> love; but its
infant cousin, that starts into life on cold Saint
Valentine’s morning, and sits by the fire rocking
its own cradle, and listening all day long for the
“sweet thunder” of the twopenny postman’s
knock!&mdash;Hail! February! Virgin mother of
this love of all loves, which dies almost the day
that it is born, and yet leaves the odour of its
sweetness upon the whole after life of those who
were not too wise to admit it for a moment to
their embraces!</p>

<p>The sage reader must not begrudge me these
innocent little rhapsodies. He must remember
that all are not so wise and staid as he; and as
in January he permitted me to be, for a moment,
a ranting schoolboy, so in February he must not
object to my reminding him that there are such
persons in the world as young ladies who have
not yet finished their education! He must not
insist that, “because <i>he</i> is virtuous, there shall
be no more cakes and ale.” Besides, to be candid,
I do not see that it is quite fair to complain of
us anonymous writers, even if we do occasionally
insinuate into our lucubrations a few lines that
are directed to our own exclusive satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
In fact, the privilege of writing nonsense now
and then is the sweetest source of our emolument,
and one which, if our readers attempt to
cut us off from altogether, they may rest assured
that we shall very soon <i>strike</i>, and demand higher
pay in other respects than those only true patrons
of literature, the booksellers, can afford to give;
for if a man is always to write sense and reason,
he might as well turn <i>author</i> at once,&mdash;which we
“gentlemen who write with ease” flatter ourselves
that none of us are. I put it to the candour
of Mr. Whittaker himself, whether, if I
would consent to place my name in the corner
of each of these portraits of the Months (<i>so and
so pinxit</i>, 1825), he would not willingly give
me double price for them, and reckon upon
remunerating himself from the purchaser in
proportion? Then let him use his interest
with the critics to allow me but half a page
of nonsense in each paper, and I consent to
forego all this profit. As for the fame, I am
content to leave posterity in the lurch, and live
only till I die.</p>

<p>Having now expended <i>my</i> portion of this paper,
I shall henceforth willingly “keep bounds” till
the next month; to which end, however, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
be permitted to call in the aid of my able suggestive,
Now.</p>

<p>Now, the Christmas holidays are over, and all
the snow in Russia could not make the first
Monday in this month look any other than <i>black</i>,
in the home-loving eyes of little schoolboys; and
the streets of London are once more evacuated
of happy wondering faces, that look any way
but straight before them; and sobs are heard,
and sorrowful faces seen to issue from sundry
postchaises that carry sixteen inside, exclusive of
cakes and boxes; and theatres are no longer
conscious of unconscious <i>eclats de rire</i>, but the
whole audience is like Mr. Wordsworth’s cloud,
“which moveth altogether, if it move at all.”</p>

<p><i>En revanche</i>, now newspaper editors begin to
think of disporting themselves; for the great
national school for “children of a larger growth”
is met in Saint Stephen’s Chapel, “for the
<i>despatch</i> of business” and of time; and consequently
newspapers have become a nonentity;
and those writers who are “constant readers”
find their occupation gone.</p>

<p>Now, the stones of Bond Street dance for joy,
while they “prate of the whereabout” of innumerable
wheels; which latter are so happy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
meet again after a long absence, that they rush
into each other’s embraces, “wheel within wheel,”
and there’s no getting them asunder.</p>

<p>Now, the Italian Opera is open, and the house
is full; but if asked on the subject, you may
safely say that “nobody was there;” for the
<i>flats</i> that you meet with in the pit evidently indicate
that their wearers appertain to certain
counters and counting-houses in the city, or serve
those that do&mdash;having “received orders” for the
Opera in the way of their business.</p>

<p>Now, a sudden thaw, after a week’s frost,
puts the pedestrians of Cheapside into a pretty
pickle.</p>

<p>Now, the <i>trottoir</i> of St. James’s Street begins
to know itself again; the steps of Raggett’s are
proud of being pressed by right honourable feet;
and <i>the dandies’ watch-tower</i> is once more peopled
with playful peers, peering after beautiful frailties
in furred pelisses.</p>

<p>Now, on fine Sundays, the citizens and their
wives begin to hie them to Hyde Park, and
having attained Wellington Walk, fancy that
there is not more than two pins to choose between
them and their betters on the other side
the rail; while these latter, having come abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
to take the air (of the insides of their carriages),
and kill the time, and cure the vapours,
permit inquisitive equestrians to gaze at
them through plate-glass, and fancy, not without
reason, that they look like flowers seen through
flowing water: Lady O&mdash;&mdash;, for example, like
an overblown rose; Lady H&mdash;&mdash;, like a painted-lady
pea; the Countess of B&mdash;&mdash;, like a newly-opened
apple-blossom; and her demure-looking
little sister beside her, like a <i>prim</i>-rose.</p>

<p>Now, winter being only on the wane, and
spring only on the approach, Fashion, for once
in the year, begins to feel herself in a state of
interregnum, and her ministers, the milliners and
tailors, don’t know what to think. Mrs. Bean
shakes her head like Lord Burleigh, and declines
to determine as to what may be the fate of
future waists; and Mr. Stultz is equally cautious
of committing himself in the affair of collars;
and both agree in coming to the same conclusion
with the statesman in Tom Thumb, that, “as
near as they can guess, they cannot tell!” Now,
therefore, the fashionable shops are shorn of their
beams, and none can show wares that are strictly
in season, except the stationer’s. But <i>his</i>, which
for all the rest of the year is dullest of the dull,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
is now, for the first fourteen days, gayest of the
gay; for here the poetry of love, and the love of
poetry, are displayed under all possible and impossible
forms and metaphors,&mdash;from little cupids
creeping out of cabbage-roses, to large overgrown
hearts stuffed with double-headed arrows, and
uttering piteous complaints in verse, while they
fry in their own flames. And this brings us
safe back to the point from which we somewhat
prematurely set out; for Now, on good Saint
Valentine’s eve, all the rising generation of this
metropolis, who feel that they have reached the
age of <i>in</i>discretion, think it full time for them
to fall in love, or be fallen in love with. Accordingly,
infinite are the crow-quills that move
mincingly between embossed margins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And those <i>rhyme</i> now who never rhymed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who always rhymed now rhyme the more;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to the utter dismay of the newly-appointed twopenny
postman the next morning; who curses
Saint Valentine almost as bitterly as does, in her
secret heart, yonder sulky sempstress, who has
not been called upon for a single twopence out
of all the two hundred thousand<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> extra ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
that have been drawn from willing pockets, and
dropped into canvas bags, on this eventful day.
She may take my word for it that the said sulkiness,
which has some show of reason in it to-day,
is in the habit of visiting her pretty face oftener
than it is called for. If it were not so, she would
not have had cause for it now.</p>

<p>But good Bishop Valentine is a pluralist, and
holds another see besides that of London:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">“All the air is his diocese,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And all the chirping choristers<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And other birds are his parishioners:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He marries every year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lyrique lark, and the grave whispering dove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sparrow, that neglects his life for love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The household bird with the red stomacher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes the blackbird speed as soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As doth the goldfinch or the halcyon.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let us be off to the country without more
ado; for who can stay in London in the face of
such epithets as these, that seem to compel us,
with their sweet magic, to go in search of the
sounds and sights that they characterise? “The
<i>lyric</i> lark!” Why a modern poet might live for
a whole season on that one epithet! Nay, there
be those that <i>have</i> lived on it for a longer time,
perhaps without knowing that it did not belong
to them!&mdash;“The sparrow that <i>neglects his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
for love</i>!” “The <i>household</i> bird, <i>with the red
stomacher</i>!”&mdash;That a poet who could write in this
manner, for pages together, should be almost entirely
unknown to modern <i>readers</i> (except to those
of a late number of the Retrospective Review),
would be somewhat astonishing, if it were not for
the consideration that he is so well known to
modern <i>writers</i>! It would be doing both parties
justice if some one would point out a few of the
<i>coincidences</i> that occur between them. In the
mean time, <i>we</i> shall be doing better in looking
abroad for ourselves into that nature to which
<i>he</i> looked, and seeing what she offers worthy of
particular observation, in the course of this last
month of winter in the Country, though it is the
first in London. Not that we shall, as yet, find
much to attract our attention in regard to the
movements of the above-named “parishioners”
of good Bishop Valentine; for though he gives
them full authority to marry now as soon as they
please, Frost forbids the bans for the present;
and when there is no love going forward in the
feathered world, there is little or no singing.
On the contrary, even the pert sparrows still go
moping and sulking about silently, or sit with
ruffled plumes and drooping wings, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
bare branches, watching all day long for their
scanty dole of crums, and thinking of nothing
else. The “lyric lark,” indeed, may already
be heard; the thrush and blackbird begin to
practise their spring notes faintly; and the
yellow-hammer, the chaffinch, and the wren,
utter a single stanza or so, at long intervals:
but all this can scarcely be called singing, but
rather talking of it; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I shall not ask Jean Jacques Rousseau<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If birds confabulate, or no;”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but shall determine at once that they do; at
least if any dependence can be placed on eyes
and ears. In short, the only bird that really <i>is</i>
a bird this month, is he “with the red stomacher.”
And he, with his low plaintive piping,
his silent spirit-like motions, and sudden and mysterious
appearings and disappearings,&mdash;coming
in an instant before us no one can tell whence,
and going as silently and as suddenly no one
knows whither,&mdash;and, above all, his sweet and
pert, yet timid confidence in man&mdash;all these, to
those who are happy enough to have nothing
better to do than to watch them, almost make
up for the absence of all his blithe brethren.</p>

<p>As for the general face of nature, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
find <i>that</i> in much the same apparent state as we
left it last month. And we must look into its
individual features very minutely, if we would
discover any change even in them. The trees
are still utterly bare; the skies are cold and
gray; the paths and ways are, for the most part,
dank and miry; and the air is either damp and
clinging, or bitter, eager, and shrewd. But then
what days of soft air and sunshine, and unbroken
blue sky, do now and then intervene, and transport
us into the very heart of May, and make us
look about and wonder what is become of the
green leaves and the flowers!</p>

<p>Now, hard frosts, if they come at all, are followed
by sudden thaws; and now, therefore, if
ever, the mysterious old song of our school days
stands a chance of being verified, which sings of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Three children sliding on the ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All on a <i>summer’s</i> day!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, the labour of the husbandman recommences;
and it is pleasant to watch (from your
library window) the plough-team moving almost
imperceptibly along, upon the distant upland
that the bare trees have disclosed to you. And
now, by the way, if you are wise, you will get
acquainted with all the little spots that are thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
by the bareness of the trees, laid open to you,
in order that, when the summer comes, and you
cannot <i>look at</i> them, you may be able to <i>see</i>
them still.</p>

<p>But we must not neglect the garden; for
though “Nature’s journeymen,” the gardeners,
are undergoing an ignoble leisure this month, it
is not so with Nature herself. She is as busy as
ever, if not openly and obviously, secretly, and
in the hearts of her sweet subjects the flowers;
stirring them up to that rich rivalry of beauty
which is to greet the first footsteps of Spring,
and teaching them to prepare themselves for her
advent, as young maidens prepare, months beforehand,
for the marriage festival of some dear
friend.</p>

<p>If the flowers think and feel (and he who dares
to say that they do not is either a fool or a philosopher&mdash;let
him choose between the imputations!)&mdash;if
the flowers think and feel, what a
commotion must be working within their silent
hearts, when the pinions of Winter begin to grow,
and indicate that he is at least meditating his
flight! Then do <i>they</i>, too, begin to meditate on
May-day, and think on the delight with which
they shall once more breathe the fresh air, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
they have leave to escape from their subterranean
prisons; for now, towards the latter end of this
month, they are all of them at least awake from
their winter slumbers, and most are busily working
at their gay toilets, and weaving their fantastic
robes, and shaping their trim forms, and
distilling their rich essences, and, in short, getting
ready in all things, that they may be duly prepared
to join the bright procession of beauty
that is to greet and glorify the annual coming on
of their sovereign lady, the Spring. It is true
none of all this can be seen. But what a race
should we be, if we knew and cared to know of
nothing, but what we can see and prove!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Whose mind is but the mind of his own eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a slave&mdash;the meanest you can meet.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But there is much going on in the garden now
that may be seen by “the naked eye” of those
who carefully look for it. The bloom-buds of
the shrubs and fruit-trees are obviously swelling;
and the leaves of the lilac are ready to burst
forth at the first favourable call. The laurestinus
still braves the winds and the frosts, and blooms
in blithe defiance of them. So does the China
rose, but meekly, and like a maiden who <i>will</i> not
droop though her lover <i>be</i> away; because she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
knows that he is true to her, and will soon
return.</p>

<p>Now, too, the viable heralds of Spring approach,
but do not appear; or rather, they appear,
but have not yet put on their gorgeous
tabards or surcoats of many colours. The tulips
are but just showing themselves, shrouded closely
in their sheltering alcoves of dull green. The
hyacinths, too, have sent up their trim fences of
green, and are just peeping up from the midst
of them in their green veils,&mdash;the cheek of each
flower-bud pressed and clustering against that of
its fellow, like a host of little heads peeping out
from the porch of an ivy-bound cottage, as the
London coach passes.</p>

<p>Now, too, those pretty orphans, the crocuses
and snowdrops&mdash;those foundlings, that belong
neither to Winter nor Spring&mdash;show their modest
faces scarcely an inch above the dark earth,
as if they were afraid to rise from it, lest a
stray March wind should whistle them away.</p>

<p>Finally, now appear, towards the latter end of
the month, those flowers that actually belong to
Spring&mdash;that do not either herald her approach,
or follow in her train, but are in fact a part of
her, and prove that she is virtually with us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
though she chooses to remain incognita for a
time. The prettiest and most piquant of these
in appearance are the brilliant little Hepaticas,
crowding up in sparkling companies from the
midst of their dark ivy-like leaves, and looking
more like gems than flowers.</p>

<p>The next in brilliance are the Anemonies, as
gay in their colours, and more various, but not
so profuse of their charms as their pretty relation
Hepatica, and more jealous of each other’s
beauty; as well they may, for what flower can
vie with them for exquisite delicacy of hue and
elegant fragility?</p>

<p>The primroses, polyanthuses, and daisies that
venture to show themselves this month, we will
not greet; not because we are not even more
pleased to see them than their gayer and more
gaudy rivals; but the truth is, that they have
no real claim upon our attention till next month,
as their pale hues and weakly forms evidently
indicate.</p>

<p>In taking leave of the Country for this month,
let me not forget to mention that sure “prophet
of delight and mirth,” the Common Pilewort, or
Lesser Celandine; about which (and what more
can I say to interest the reader in its favour?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
Mr. Wordsworth has written two whole poems.
Its little yellow stars may now be seen gemming
the woodsides, when all around is cold, comfortless,
and dead.</p>

<p>I have said that I designed to prove this to
be the best of all possible months. Is the reader
still incredulous as to its surpassing merits?
Then be it known to him that I should insist on
its supremacy, if it were only in virtue of <i>one</i>
birthday which it includes: and one that the
reader would never guess, for the best of all
reasons. It is <i>not</i> that of “the wisest of mankind,”
Lord Bacon, on the third; or of “the
starry Galileo,” on the nineteenth; or of the
“matchless master of high sounds,” Handel, on
the twenty-fourth. True February does include
all these memorable days, and let it be valued
accordingly. But it includes another day, which
is worth them all <i>to me</i>, since it gave to the
world, the narrow world of some half dozen
loving hearts, one who is wiser in her simplicity
than the first of the abovenamed, since
the results of that wisdom are virtue and happiness;
who is more far-darting in her mental
glance than the second, inasmuch as an instinctive
<i>sentiment</i> of the truth is more infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
than the clearest <i>perception</i> of it; and whose
every thought and look and motion are more
“softly sweet” and musical than all the “Lydian
measures” of the third; and, deprived of
whom, those who have once been accustomed to
live within the light of her countenance would
find all the wisdom of the first to be foolishness,
all the stars of the second dark, and all the
harmony of the third worse than discord.</p>

<p>Gentlest of readers (for I had need have
such), pardon me this one rhapsody, and I promise
to be as “sobersuited” as the editor of an
Encyclopedia, for this two months to come. Nothing,
not even the nightingale’s song in the last
week in April, shall move me from my propriety.
But I will candidly confess, that the effects of
May-day morning are more than I can venture
to answer for. Even the chimney-sweepers are
allowed to disport themselves then; so that
when that arrives, there’s no knowing what may
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><br />{43}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MARCH" id="MARCH"></a>MARCH.</h2>

<p>If there be a Month the aspect of which is
less amiable, and its manners and habits less
prepossessing, than those of all the rest (which
I am loath to admit), that month is March. The
burning heats of midsummer (when they shall
come to us at the prophetic call of the Quarterly
Reviewers&mdash;which they never will) we shall find
no difficulty in bearing; and the frosts and snows
of December and January are as welcome, to
those who know their value, as the flowers in
May. Nay&mdash;the so much vituperated fogs of
November I by no means set my face against;
on the contrary, I have a kind of appetite for
them, both corporeal and mental; as I shall
prove, and endeavour to justify in its due
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
In fact, and by the by, November is a month
that has not been fairly dealt by; and, for my
part, I think it should by no means have been
fixed upon as that which is <i>par excellence</i> the
month best adapted to hang and drown oneself
in;&mdash;seeing that, to a wise man, <i>that</i> should never
be an affair of atmosphere. But if a month must
be set apart for such a proces, (on the same
principle which determines that we are bound to
<i>begin</i> our worldly concerns on a particular day&mdash;viz.
Saturday&mdash;and would therefore, by parity
of reasoning, call upon us to end them with a
similar view to times and seasons), let that month
be henceforth March; for it has, at this present
writing, no one characteristic by which to designate
it,&mdash;being neither Spring, Summer, Autumn,
nor Winter, but only March.</p>

<p>But what I particularly object to in March is
its winds. They say</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“March winds and April showers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring forth May flowers.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I doubt the fact. They may <i>call</i> them
forth, perhaps,&mdash;whistling over the roofs of their
subterraneous dwellings, to let them know that
Winter is past and gone. Or, in our disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
to “turn diseases to commodities,” let us regard
them as the expectant damsel does the sound of
the mail coach horn that whisks through the
village, as she lies in bed at midnight, and tells
her that <i>to-morrow</i> she may look for a letter
from her absent swain.</p>

<p>The only other express and specific reason
why I object to March, is that she drives hares
mad; which is a great fault. But be all this as
it may, she is still fraught with merits; and let
us proceed, without more ado, to point out a few
of them. And first of the country;&mdash;to which,
by the way, I have not hitherto allowed its due
supremacy&mdash;for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“God made the Country, but man made the Town.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, then, even the winds of March, notwithstanding
all that we have insinuated in their
disfavour, are far from being virtueless; for they
come careering over our fields, and roads, and
pathways, and while they dry up the damps that
the thaws had let loose, and the previous frosts
had prevented from sinking into the earth, “pipe
to the spirit ditties” the words of which tell tales
of the forthcoming flowers. And not only so,
but occasionally they are caught bearing away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
upon their rough wings the mingled odours of
violet and daffodil, both of which have already
ventured to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come before the swallow dares, and take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds of March with beauty.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The general face of nature has not much
changed in appearance since we left it in February;
though its internal economy has made
an important step in advance. The sap is alive
in the seemingly sleeping trunks that every where
surround us, and is beginning to mount slowly
to its destination; and the embryo blooms are
almost visibly struggling towards light and life,
beneath their rough, unpromising outer coats&mdash;unpromising
to the idle, the unthinking, and the
inobservant; but to the eye that “can see
Othello’s visage in his mind,” bright and beautiful,
in virtue of the brightness and the beauty
that they cover, but not conceal. Now, too, the
dark earth becomes soft and tractable, and yields
to the kindly constraint that calls upon it to
teem with new life,&mdash;crumbling to the touch,
that it may the better clasp in its fragrant bosom
the rudiments of that gay, but ephemeral creation
which are born with the spring, only “to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
their race rejoicing” into the lap of summer,
and there yield up their sweet breath, a willing
incense at the shrine of that nature the spirit
of which is endless constancy growing out of
endless change. Must I tell the reader this in
plainer prose?&mdash;Now, then, is the time to sow
the seeds of most of the annual flowering plants;
particularly of those which we all know and
love&mdash;such as Sweet Pea, the most feminine of
flowers, that must have a kind hand to tend its
youth, and a supporting arm to cling to in its
maturity, or it grovels in the dust, and straggles
away into an unsightly weed; and Mignionette,
with a name as sweet as its breath,&mdash;that loves
“within a gentle bosom to be laid,” and makes
haste to die there, lest its white lodging should
be changed; and Larkspur, trim, gay, and bold,
the gallant of the garden; and Lupines, blue,
and yellow, and rose coloured, with their winged
flowers hovering above their starry leaves; and
a host of others, that we must try to characterise
as they come in turn before us.</p>

<p>Now, too, we have some of the bulbous rooted
flowers at their best, particularly the pretty
Crocuses, yellow, blue, striped, and white; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
others, the Narcissus, Hyacinths, and Tulips,
are visibly hastening towards their perfection.</p>

<p>Those spring flowers, too, which ventured to
show themselves last month before they had well
recovered from their winter trance, have now
grown bold in their renewed strength, and look
the winds in the face fearlessly. Perhaps the
most poetical of these, because the most pathetic
in their pale and pining beauty, are the Primroses.
Their bold and bright-eyed relatives the
Polyanthuses (no two alike) are also now all on
the look out for lovers, among the bees that
the warm sunny mornings already begin to call
forth.</p>

<p>These, with the still prevailing Hepaticas and
Anemonies, the Daisies that start up singly here
and there, an early Wall-flower, the pretty pink
rods of the Mezereon, and (in the woods) the
lovely Wind-flower, or white Wood-anemone,
constitute the principal wealth of this preparatory
month.</p>

<p>Now, too, the tender green of spring first
begins to peep forth from the straggling branches
of the hedge-row Elder, the trim Lilac, and the
thin threads of the stream enamoured Willow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
the first to put on its spring clothing, and the
last to leave it off. And if we look into the
kitchen garden, there too we may chance to find
those forest trees in miniature, the Gooseberries
and Currants, letting their leaves and blossoms
(both of a colour) look forth together, hand in
hand, in search of the April sun before it arrives,
as the lark mounts upward to seek for it before
it has risen in the morning. It will be well if
these early adventurers-forth do not encounter a
cutting easterly blast; or still worse, a deceitful
breeze, that tempts them to its embraces by its
milder breath, only to shower diseases upon
them. But if they <i>will</i> be out on the watch for
Spring before she calls them, they must be content
to take their chance.</p>

<p>NOW, about the middle of the month, a
strange commotion may be seen and heard among
the winged creatures, portending momentous matters.
The lark is high up in the cold air before
day-light; and his chosen mistress is listening
to him down among the dank grass, with the dew
still upon her unshaken wing. The Robin, too,
has left off, for a brief season, his low plaintive
piping, which it must be confessed was poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
forth for his own exclusive satisfaction, and,
reckoning on his spruce looks and sparkling
eyes, issues his quick peremptory love-call, in a
somewhat ungallant and husband-like manner.</p>

<p>The Sparrows, who have lately been sulking
silently about from tree to tree, with ruffled
plumes and drooping wings, now spruce themselves
up till they do not look half their former
size; and if it were not pairing-time, one might
fancy that there was more of war than of love
in their noisy squabblings. But the crouching
forms, quivering wings, and murmuring bills, of
yonder pair that have quitted for a moment the
clamorous cabal, can indicate the movements of
but <i>one</i> passion.</p>

<p>But we must leave the feathered tribe for the
present:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sacred be love from sight, whate’er it is.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We shall have many opportunities of observing
their pretty ways hereafter.</p>

<p>Now, also, the Ants (with whom we shall have
a crow to pick by and by) first begin to show
themselves from their subterranean sleeping-rooms;
those winged abortions, the Bats, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>plex
the eyes of evening wanderers by their
seeming ubiquity; and the Owls hold scientific
converse with each other at half a mile distance.</p>

<p>Lastly, now we meet with one of the prettiest,
yet most pathetic sights that the animal world presents;
the early Lambs, dropped, in their tottering
and bleating helplessness, upon the cold skirts
of winter, and hiding their frail forms from the
March winds, by crouching down on the sheltered
side of their dams.</p>

<p>Now, quitting the country till next month,
we find London all alive, Lent and Lady-day
notwithstanding; for the latter is but a day,
after all; and he must have a very countrified conscience
who cannot satisfy it as to the former, by
doing penance once or twice at an Oratorio, and
hearing comic songs sung in a foreign tongue;
or, if this does not do, he may fast if he pleases,
every Friday, by eating salt fish in addition to
the rest of his fare.</p>

<p>Now, the citizens have pretty well left off their
annual visitings, and given the great ones leave
to begin; so that there is no sleep to be had
in the neighbourhood of May-fair, for love or
money, after one in the morning.</p>

<p>Now, the dress boxes of the winter houses can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
occasionally boast a baronet’s lady; this, however,
being the extent of their attainments in
that way; for how can the great be expected to
listen to Shakespear under the same roof with
their shop-keepers? There is, in fact, no denying
that the said great are marvellously at the mercy
of the said little, in the matter of amusement;
and there is no saying whether the latter will
not, some day or other, make an inroad upon
Almack’s itself. Now, however, in spite of the
said inroads, the best boxes at the Opera do begin
to be worth exploring, since a beautiful Englishwoman
of high fashion is “a sight to set before
a king.”</p>

<p>Now, the actors (all but the singing ones) in
their secret hearts put up periodical prayers for
the annual agitation of the Catholic Question;
for without some stimulus of this kind, to correct
the laxity of our religious morals, there is no
knowing how soon they may cease to give thanks
for three Sundays in the week during Lent.</p>

<p>Now, (during the said pious period) occasionally
an inadvertent apprentice gets leave to go
to “the play” on a Wednesday or Friday; and,
having taken his seat in the one shilling gallery,
wonders during six long hours what can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
come to the players, that they do nothing but
sit in a row with their hands before them, in
front of a pyramid of fiddlers, and break silence
now and then by singing a psalm; for a psalm
he is sure it must be, though he never heard it
at church.</p>

<p>Now, every other day, the four sides of the
newspapers offer to the wearied eye one unbroken
ocean of <i>long-primer</i>; to the infinite abridgement
of the labour of Chapter Coffee House quidnuncs,
who find that they have only one sheet to
get through instead of ten; and to the entire discomfiture
of the conscientious reader, who makes
it a point of duty to spell through all that he
pays for, avowed advertisements included; for
in these latter there is some variety&mdash;of which no
one can accuse the parliamentary speeches. By
the by, it would be but consistent in the Times
to bestow their ingenuous prefix of [<i>advertisement</i>]
on a few of the last named effusions.
And if they were placed under the head of
“Want Places,” nobody but the advertiser
would see cause to complain of the mistake.</p>

<p>Now, Fashion is on the point of awaking from
her periodical sleep, attended by Mesdames Bean,
Bell, and Pierrepoint on one side of her couch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
and Messieurs Myers, Stultz, and Davison on the
other; each individual of each party watching
with apparent anxiety to catch the first glance
of her opening eye, in order to direct their several
movements accordingly; but each having
previously determined on those movements as
definitively as if their legitimate monarch and
directress had nothing to do with matter; for, to
say truth, notwithstanding her boasted legitimacy,
Fashion has but a very limited control,
even in her own court; the real government being
an Oligarchy, the members of which are each lords
paramount in their own particular departments.
Who, in fact, shall dispute an epaulet of Miss
Pierrepoint’s? and when Mr. Myers has achieved
a collar, who shall call it in question?</p>

<p>Now, Hyde Park is worth walking in at four
o’clock of a fine week day, though the trees are
still bare; for there, as sure as the sunshine
comes, shall be seen sauntering beneath it three
distinct classes of fashionables; namely, first, the
fair immaculates from the mansions about May
Fair, who loll listlessly in their elegant equipages,
and occasionally eye, with an air of infinite disdain,
the second class, who are peregrinating on
the other side the bar,&mdash;the fair frailties from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
neighbourhood of the New Road; which latter,
more magnanimous than their betters, and less
envious, are content, for their parts, to appropriate
the greater portion of the attentions of the
third class&mdash;the ineffables and exquisites from
Long’s, and Stevens’s. Among these last-named
class something particular indeed must have
happened if you do not recognise that <i>arbiter
elegantiarum</i> of actresses, the marquis of W&mdash;&mdash;;
that delighter in dennets and decaying beauties,
the honourable L&mdash;&mdash; S&mdash;&mdash;; and that prince-pretty-man
of rake-hells and roués little George
W&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><br />{57}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APRIL" id="APRIL"></a>APRIL.</h2>

<p>April is come! “proud&mdash;pied April!” and
“hath put a spirit of youth in every thing.”
Shall our portrait of her, then, alone lack that
spirit? Not if words can speak the feelings
from which they spring. “Spring!” See how
the name comes uncalled-for; as if to hint that
it should have stood in the place of “April.”
But April <i>is</i> spring&mdash;the only spring month that
we possess in this egregious climate of ours.
Let us, then, make the most of it.</p>

<p>April is at once the most juvenile of the
Months, and the most feminine&mdash;never knowing
her own mind for a day together. Fickle as a
fond maiden with her first lover;&mdash;coying it with
the young Sun till he withdraws his beams from
her, and then weeping till she gets them back
again. High-fantastical as the seething wit of
a poet, that sees a world of beauty growing be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>neath
his hand, and fancies that he has created
it, whereas it is it that has created him a poet;
for it is Nature that makes April, not April
Nature.</p>

<p>April is doubtless the sweetest month of all
the year; partly because it ushers in the May,
and partly for its own sake, so far as any thing
can be valuable without reference to any thing
else. It is, to May and June, what “sweet
fifteen,” in the age of woman, is to passion-stricken
eighteen, and perfect two-and-twenty.
It is, to the confirmed Summer, what the previous
hope of joy is to the full fruition; what
the boyish dream of love is to love itself. It is
indeed the month of promises; and what are
twenty performances compared with one promise?
When a promise of delight is fulfilled,
it is over and done with; but while it remains a
promise, it remains a hope: and what is all
good, but the hope of good? What is every
<i>to-day</i> of our life, but the hope (or the fear) of
to-morrow? April, then, is worth two Mays,
because it tells tales of May in every sigh that it
breathes, and every tear that it lets fall. It is
the harbinger, the herald, the promise, the prophecy,
the foretaste of all the beauties that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
to follow it&mdash;of all, and more&mdash;of all the delights
of Summer, and all the “pride, pomp, and circumstance
of glorious” Autumn. It is fraught
with beauties itself that no other month can
bring before us, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“It bears a glass which shews us many more.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for April herself, her life is one sweet
alternation of smiles and sighs and tears, and
tears and sighs and smiles, till it is consummated
at last in the open laughter of May. It is like&mdash;in
short, it is like nothing in the world but “an
April day.” And her charms&mdash;but really I
must cease to look upon the face of this fair
month generally, lest, like a painter in the presence
of his mistress, I grow too enamoured to
give a correct resemblance. I must gaze upon
her sweet beauties one by one, or I shall never
be able to think and treat of her in any other
light than that of <i>the Spring</i>; which is a mere
abstraction,&mdash;delightful to think of, but, like all
other abstractions, not to be depicted or described.</p>

<p>Before I proceed to do this, however, let me
inform the reader that what I have hitherto said
of April, and have yet to say, is intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
apply, not to this or that April in particular&mdash;not
to April eighteen hundred and twenty-four,
or fourteen, or thirty-four&mdash;but to <span class="smcap">April</span> <i>par
excellence</i>; that is to say, what April (“not to
speak it profanely”) <i>ought to be</i>. In short, I
have no intention of being <i>personal</i> in my remarks;
and if the April which I am describing
should happen to differ, in any essential particulars,
from the one in whose presence I am
describing it, neither the month nor the reader
must regard this as a covert libel or satire. The
truth is that, for what reason I know not&mdash;whether
to put to shame the predictions of the
Quarterly Reviewers, or to punish us Islanders
for our manifold follies and iniquities, or from
any quarrel, as of old, between Oberon and
Titania&mdash;but certain it is that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The seasons alter: hoary headed frosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on old Hyems’ thin and icy crown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The chilling Autumn, angry Winter, change<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wonted liveries; and the amazed world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By their increase, now knows not which is which.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is of April, then, as she is when Nature is
in her happiest mood, that I am now to speak;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
and we will take her in the prime of her life, and
our first place of rendezvous shall be the open
fields.</p>

<p>What a sweet flush of new green has started
up to the face of this meadow! And the new-born
Daisies that stud it here and there, give it
the look of an emerald sky powdered with snowy
stars. In making our way to yonder hedgerow,
which divides the meadow from the little copse
that lines one side of it, let us not take the
shortest way, but keep religiously to the little
footpath; for the young grass is as yet too tender
to bear being trod upon; and the young lambs
themselves, while they go cropping its crisp
points, let the sweet daisies alone, as if they
loved to look upon a sight as pretty and as innocent
as themselves.</p>

<p>I have been hitherto very chary of appealing
to the poets in these pleasant papers; because
they are people that, if you give them an inch,
even in a span-long essay of this kind, always
endeavour to lay hands on the whole of it. They
are like the young cuckoos, that if once they get
hatched within a nest, always contrive to oust
the natural inhabitants. But when the Daisy,
“la douce Marguerite,” is in question, how can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
I refrain from pronouncing a blessing on the
bard who has, by his sweet praise of this “unassuming
commonplace of nature,” revived that
general love for it, which, until lately, was confined
to the hearts of “the old poets,” and of
those young poets of all times, the little children?
But I need not do this, for he has his reward
already, in the fulfilment of that prophecy
with which he closes his address to his darling
flower:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear shalt thou be to future men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in old time.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does the reader, now that I have brought before
him, in company with each other, “this child
of the year,” and the gentlest and most eloquent
of all her lovers, desire to hear a few more of
the compliments that he has paid to her, without
the trouble of leaving the fields, and opening a
book? I can afford but a few; for beneath
yonder hedgerow, and within the twilight of the
copse behind it, there are flocks of other sweet
flowers, waiting for their praise.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When soothed awhile by milder airs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee Winter in the garland wears<br /></span>

<p>[By the by, I cannot let pass this epithet,
“melancholy,” without protesting most strenuously
against the above application of it. Seldom,
indeed, is it that the poet before us falls
into an error of this kind; and it is <i>therefore</i>
that I point it out.]</p>

<p>What poetry is here! It “dallies with the
innocence” of the poet and of the flower, till we
know not which to love best. But we must turn
at once from the fascination of both, and not
allow them again to seduce us from our duty to
the rest of those sweet “children of the year”
that are courting our attention.</p>

<p>See, upon the sloping sides of this bank, beneath
the hedgerow, what companies of Primroses
are dedicating their pale beauties to the
pleasant breeze that blows over them, and looking
as faint withal as if they had senses that
could “ache” at the rich sweetness of the hidden
Violets that are growing here and there among
them.</p>

<p>The intermediate spots of the bank are now
nearly covered from sight by the various green
weeds that sprout up every where&mdash;beginning to
fill the interstices between the lower stems of the
Hazel, the Hawthorn, the Sloe, the Eglantine,
and the Woodbine, which unite their friendly
arms together above, to form the natural in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>closure,&mdash;that
prettiest feature in our English
scenery, or at least that which communicates a
picturesque beauty to all the rest.</p>

<p>Of the above-named shrubs, the Hazel, you
see, is scarcely as yet in leaf; the scattered
leaves of the Woodbine, of a dull purplish green,
are fully spread; the Sloe is in blossom, offering
a pretty but scentless imitation of the sweet
hawthorn bloom that is to come next month.
This latter is now vigorously putting forth its
crisp and delicate filigree work of tender green,
tipped with red; and the Eglantine, or wild
rose, is opening its green hands, as if to welcome
the sun.</p>

<p>Entering the little copse which this inclosure
separates from the meadow, we shall find, on the
ground, all the low and creeping plants pushing
forth their various shaped leaves&mdash;stars, fans,
blades, fingers, fringes, and a score of other fanciful
forms; and some of them bearing the prettiest
flowers in the world. Conspicuous among
these, in addition to those of February and
March, are the elegant little Wood-sorrel, with
its delicately pencilled cups; the pretty Wild
Strawberry; the common blue Hyacinth,&mdash;so
delightful when it comes upon you in innu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>merable
flocks while you are thinking of nothing
less; the gently-stooping Harebell, the most
fragile of all flowers, yet braving the angriest
winds of heaven, by bowing to the ground before
them; and, lastly, that strangest of flowers (if
flower it be) called by the country folks Cuckoo-pint,
and by the children Lords and Ladies.</p>

<p>Still passing on through this copse, we shall
find all the young forest trees, except the oaks,
in a kind of half-dress, like so many village
maidens in their trim bodices, and with their
hair in papers. Among these are conspicuous
the graceful Birch, hanging its head like a half-shamefaced,
half-affected damsel; the trim Beech,
spruce as a village gallant dressed for the fair;
the rough-rinded Elm, grave and sedate looking,
even in its youth, and already bespeaking the
future “green-robed senator of mighty woods.”
These, with the white-stemmed Ash, the Alder,
the artificial-looking Hornbeam, and the as yet
bare Oak, make up this silent but happy company,
who are to stand here on the same spot all
their lives, looking upward to the clouds and
the stars, and downward to the star-like flowers,
till we and our posterity (who pride ourselves
on our superiority over them) are laid in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
earth of which <i>they</i> alone are the true inheriters.</p>

<p>But who ever heard of choosing a warm April
morning to moralize in? Let us wait till winter
for that; and in the mean time pass out of this
pleasant little copse, and make our way windingly
towards the village.</p>

<p>In the little green lane that leads to it we
meet with nothing very different from what we
have already noticed; unless it be an early Bee
booming past us, or hovering for a moment over
the snowy flower of the Lady-smock; or a village
boy looking upward with hand-shaded brow after
the mounting Lark, while he holds in his other
hand the tether of a young heifer, that he has
led forth to take her first taste of the fresh-sprouting
herbage.</p>

<p>On reaching the Village Green, we cannot
choose but pause before this stately Chestnut-tree,
the smooth stem of which rises from the earth
like a dark coloured marble column, seemingly
placed there by art to support the pyramidal
fabric of beauty that surmounts it. It has just
put forth its first series of rich fan-like leaves,
each family of which is crowned by its splendid
spiral flower; the whole, at this period of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
year, forming the grandest vegetable object that
our kingdom presents, and vying in rich beauty
with any that Eastern woods can boast. And
if we could reach one of those flowers, to pluck
it, we should find that the most delicate fair ones
of the Garden or the Greenhouse do not surpass
it in elaborate pencilling and richly varied
tints. It can be likened to nothing but its own
portrait painted on velvet.</p>

<p>Farther on, across the Green, with this little
raised footpath leading to it, stands a row of
young Lindens, separating in the middle to admit
a view of the Parsonage-house; for it can be
no other. What a lovely green is theirs! and
what an exact shape in their bright circular
leaves, all alike, clustering and flapping over
each other! And their smooth pillar-like stems
shoot out from the hard gravel pathway like
artificial shafts, without a ridge, a knot, or an
inequality, till they spread forth suddenly just
above the reach of branch-plucking schoolboys.</p>

<p>The Honeysuckles, that wreathe the trellised
door of the neat dwelling, have already put forth
their dull purple-tinged leaves, at distant intervals,
on the slim shoots; but the Jasmin,
that spreads itself over the circular-topped win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>dows,
is not yet sufficiently clothed to hide the
formality of its training.</p>

<p>To the right, the fine old avenue of Elms,
forming the Walk leading to the low Church,
are sprinkled all over with their spring attire;
but not enough to form the shade that they
will a month hence. At present the blue sky
can every where be seen through them.</p>

<p>We might wander on through the Village and
its environs for a while longer, pleasantly enough,
without exhausting the objects of novelty and
interest that present themselves in this sweetest
of months; but we must get within more confined
limits, or we shall not have space to glance
at half those which more exclusively belong to
this time.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If the Garden, like the Year, is not now absolutely
at its best, it is perhaps better; inasmuch
as a pleasant promise but half performed
partakes of the best parts of both promise and
performance. Now, all is neatness and finish, or
ought to be; for the weeds have not yet began
to make head; the annual flower seeds are all
sown; the divisions and changes among the perennials,
and the removings and plantings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
shrubs, have all taken place. The Walks, too,
have all been turned and freshened, and the Turf
has began to receive its regular rollings and
mowings. Among the bulbous-rooted perennials,
all that were not in flower during the last two
months, are so now; in particular the majestic
Crown-imperial; the Tulip, beautiful as the panther,
and as proud,&mdash;standing aloof from its own
leaves; the rich double Hyacinth, clustering
like the locks of Adam; and Narcissus, pale and
passion-stricken at the sense of its own sweetness.</p>

<p>But what we are chiefly to look for now are the
fibrous-rooted and herbaceous Perennials. There
is not one of these that has not awakened from its
winter dreams, and put on at least the half of its
beauty. A few of them venture to display all
their attractions at this time, from a wise fear of
that dangerous rivalry which they must be content
to encounter if they were to wait for a month
longer; for a pretty villager might as well hope
to gain hearts at Almack’s, as a demure daisy of
a modest polyanthus think to secure its due share
of attention in presence of the glaring peonies,
flaunting roses, and towering lilies of May and
midsummer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
Now, too, those late planted Stocks and Wallflowers,
that have had strength to brave the
cutting blasts of winter, feel the benefit of their
hardihood, and show it in the profusion of their
blooms and the richness of their colours.</p>

<p>Finally, among flowers we have now the
singular spotted Fritillary; Heart’s-ease, the
“little western flower,” that cannot be looked at
or thought of without feeling its name; and the
Auricula, that richest in its texture and colour of
all the vegetable tribe, and as various as rich.</p>

<p>Among the Shrubs that form the inclosing
belt of the flower-garden, the Lilac is in full leaf,
and loaded with its heavy bunches of bloom-buds;
the common Laurel, if it has reached its
flowering age, is hanging out its meek modest
flowers, preparatory to putting forth its vigorous
summer shoots; and the Larch has on it hairy
tufts of pink, stuck here and there among its
delicate threads of green.</p>

<p>But the great charm of this month, both in
the open country and the garden, is undoubtedly
the infinite <i>green</i> which pervades it every where,
and which we had best gaze our fill at while we
may, as it lasts but a little while,&mdash;changing in a
few weeks into an endless variety of shades and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
tints, that are equivalent to as many different
colours. It is this, and the budding forth of
every living member of the vegetable world,
after its long winter death, that in fact constitutes
<span class="smcap">the Spring</span>; and the sight of which affects us
in the manner it does, from various causes&mdash;chiefly
moral and associated ones; but one of
which is unquestionably physical: I mean the
sight of so much tender green after the eye has
been condemned to look for months and months
on the mere negation of all colour, which prevails
in winter in our climate. The eye feels
cheered, cherished, and regaled by this colour,
as the tongue does by a quick and pleasant taste,
after having long palated nothing but tasteless
and insipid things.</p>

<p>This is the principal charm of Spring, no
doubt. But another, and one that is scarcely
second to this, is, the bright flush of Blossoms
that prevails over and almost hides every thing
else in the Fruit-garden and Orchard. What
exquisite differences and distinctions and resemblances
there are between all the various
blossoms of the fruit-trees; and no less in their
general effect than in their separate details! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
Almond-blossom, which comes first of all, and
while the tree is quite bare of leaves, is of a
bright blush-rose colour; and when they are
fully blown, the tree, if it has been kept to a
compact head instead of being permitted to
straggle, looks like one huge rose, magnified by
some fairy magic, to deck the bosom of some
fair giantess. The various kinds of Plum follow,
the blossoms of which are snow-white, and as full
and clustering as those of the almond. The
Peach and Nectarine, which are now full blown,
are unlike either of the above; and their sweet
effect, as if growing out of the hard bare wall, or
the rough wooden paling, is peculiarly pretty.
They are of a deep blush colour, and of a delicate
bell shape, the lips, however, divided, and
turning backward, to expose the interior to the
cherishing sun.</p>

<p>But perhaps the bloom that is richest and
most <i>promising</i> in its general appearance is that
of the Cherry, clasping its white honours all
round the long straight branches, from heel to
point, and not letting a leaf or a bit of stem be
seen, except the three or four leaves that come
as a green finish at the extremity of each branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
The other blossoms, of the Pears, and (loveliest
of all) the Apples, do not come in perfection
till next month.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In thinking of the circumstances which happen
this month in connexion with the animal world,
I scarcely know where to begin my observations,
so numerous are the subjects, and so limited the
space they must be despatched in. The Birds
must have precedence, for they are now, for once
in their lives, as busy as the bees are always.
They are getting their houses built, and seeing
to their household affairs, and concluding their
family arrangements, that when the summer and
the sunshine are fairly come, they may have
nothing to do but teach their children the last
new modes of flying and singing, and be as happy
as&mdash;birds, for the rest of the year. Now, therefore,
as in the last month, they have but little
time to sing to each other; and the Lark has the
morning sky all to himself. Not but we have
other April melodies, and one or two the <i>prémices</i>
of which belong so peculiarly to this month,
that we must listen to them for a moment, whatever
else is awaiting us. And first let us hearken
to the Cuckoo, shooting out its soft and mellow,
yet powerful voice, till it seems to fill the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
concave of the heavens with its two mysterious
notes, the most primitive of musical melodies.
Who can listen to those notes for the first time
in Spring, and not feel his school days come
back to him? And not as he did then</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;look a thousand ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bush, and tree, and sky?”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he will be likely to look in vain; for so shy
are they, that lucky (or rather <i>un</i>lucky, to my
thinking) is he who has ever <i>seen</i> a cuckoo. I
well remember that from the first moment I
saw one flutter heavily out of an old hawthorn
bush, and flurr awkwardly away across the meadow,
as I was listening in rapt attention to its
lonely voice, the mystery of the sound was gone,
and with it no small share of its beauty.</p>

<p>If we happen to be wandering forth on a warm
still evening during the last week in this month,
and passing near a roadside orchard, or skirting a
little copse in returning from our twilight ramble,
or sitting listlessly on a lawn near some thick
plantation, waiting for bedtime, we may chance
to be startled from our meditations (of whatever
kind they may be) by a sound, issuing from
among the distant leaves, that scares away the
silence in a moment, and seems to put to flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
even the darkness itself;&mdash;stirring the spirit, and
quickening the blood, as no other mere sound
can, unless it be that of a trumpet calling to
battle. That is the Nightingale’s voice. The
cold spells of winter, that had kept him so long
tongue-tied, and frozen the deep fountains of his
heart, yield before the mild breath of Spring,
and he is voluble once more. It is as if the
flood of song had been swelling within his breast
ever since it last ceased to flow; and was now
gushing forth uncontrollably, and as if he had
no will to control it: for when it does stop for
a space, it is suddenly, as if for want of breath.
In our climate the nightingale seldom sings above
six weeks; beginning usually the last week in
April. I mention this because many, who would
be delighted to hear him, do not think of going
to listen for his song till after it has ceased. I
believe it is never to be heard after the young
are hatched.</p>

<p>Now, too, the pretty, pert-looking Blackcap
first appears, and pours forth his tender and
touching love-song, scarcely inferior, in a certain
plaintive inwardness, to the autumn song of the
Robin. The mysterious little Grasshopper Lark
also runs whispering within the hedgerows; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
Redstart pipes prettily upon the apple trees; the
golden-crowned Wren chirps in the kitchen-garden,
as she watches for the new sown seeds;
and lastly, the Thrush, who has hitherto given
out but a desultory note at intervals to let us
know that he was not away, now haunts the
same tree, and frequently the same branch of it,
day after day, and sings an “English Melody”
that even Mr. Moore himself could not write
appropriate words to.</p>

<p>Though all the above-named are what are
commonly called birds of passage, yet from
their not congregating together, and from their
particular habits (except of singing) being consequently
but little observed, we are accustomed
to blend them among the general class of English
birds, and look upon them as if they belonged to
us. But now also first come among us (whether
from a far off land, or from their secret homes
within our own, remains to this day undetermined)
those mysterious and interesting strangers that
enliven all the air of Spring and Summer with
their foreign manners, and the infinite variety of
whose movements it is almost as pleasant to
watch as it is to listen to the modulations of
their vocal brethren. I allude to the Swallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
tribe, who come usually in the following order,
namely, first the Sand-Martin, the least noticeable
of the tribe, and not affecting the dwellings of
man; then the House or Chimney Swallow; then
the House Martin; and lastly the Swift. Those
who can see shoot past them, like a thought,
the first swallow of the year, and yet continue
pondering on their own affairs as if nothing had
happened, may be assured that “the seasons
and their change” were not made for them, and
that, whatever they may fancy they feel to the
contrary, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter
are to them mere words, indicating the
periods when rents are payable and interest becomes
due.</p>

<p>As the Swallow tribe do nothing, for the first
fortnight after their arrival, but disport themselves,
we will leave them and the rest of the
feathered tribe for the present. We shall have
sufficient opportunities of observing all their
pretty ways hereafter.</p>

<p>I am afraid we must now quit the country
altogether, <i>as</i> the country; not however without
mentioning that now begins that most execrable
of all practices, Angling. Now Man, “lordly
man,” first begins to set his wit to a simple fish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
and having succeeded in attracting it to his lure,
watches it for a space floundering about in its
crystal waters, in the agonies of death; and
when he is tired of this <i>sport</i>, drags it to the
green bank, among the grass, and moss, and
wild-flowers, and stains them all with its blood!<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The “gentle” reader may be sure that I would
willingly have refrained altogether from forcing
upon his attention this hateful subject, especially
amid such scenes and objects as we have just
been contemplating: but I was afraid that my
“silence” might have seemed to “give consent”
to the practice.</p>

<p>We must now transport ourselves to the environs
of London, and see what this happy season
is producing there; for to leave the very heart
of the country, and cast ourselves at once into
the very heart of town, would be likely to put
us in a temper ill suited to the time.</p>

<p>Now, on Palm Sunday, boys and girls (youths
and maidens have got much above so “childish”
a practice) may be met early in the morning, in
blithe though breakfastless companies, sallying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
forth towards the pretty outlets about Hampstead
and Highgate on one side of the water,
and Clapham and Camberwell on the other (all
of which they innocently imagine to be “The
Country”), there to sport away the pleasant hours
till dinner-time, and then return home, with joy
in their hearts, endless appetites in their stomachs,
and bunches of the Sallow Willow with its silken
bloom-buds in their hands, as trophies of their
travels.</p>

<p>Now, at last, the Easter week is arrived, and
the Poor have for once in the year the best of
it,&mdash;setting all things, but their own sovereign
will, at a wise defiance. The journeyman who
works on Easter Monday should lose his <i>caste</i>,
and be sent to the Coventry of Mechanics, wherever
that may be. In fact, it cannot happen.
On Easter Monday ranks change places; Jobson
is as good as Sir John; the “rude mechanical”
is “monarch of all he surveys” from the summit
of Greenwich Hill, and when he thinks fit
to say “It is our royal pleasure to be drunk!”
who shall dispute the proposition? Not I, for
one. When our English mechanics accuse their
betters of oppressing them, the said betters should
reverse the old appeal, and refer from Philip sober<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
to Philip drunk; and then nothing more could
be said. But <span class="ucsmcap">NOW</span>, they <i>have</i> no betters, even
in their own notion of the matter. And in the
name of all that is transitory, envy them not their
brief supremacy! It will be over before the end
of the week, and they will be as eager to return
to their labour as they now are to escape from it;
for the only thing that an Englishman, whether
high or low, cannot endure patiently for a week
together, is, unmingled amusement. At this time,
however, he is determined to try. Accordingly,
on Easter Monday all the narrow lanes and blind
alleys of our metropolis pour forth their dingy
denizens into the suburban fields and villages,
in search of the said amusement, which is plentifully
provided for them by another class, even
less enviable than the one on whose patronage
they depend; for of all callings, the most melancholy
is that of Purveyor of Pleasure to the
poor.</p>

<p>During the Monday our determined holiday
maker, as in duty bound, contrives, by the aid
of a little or not a little artificial stimulus, to be
happy in a tolerably exemplary manner. On
the Tuesday, he <i>fancies</i> himself happy to-day,
because he <i>felt</i> himself so yesterday. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
Wednesday he cannot tell what has come to
him, but every ten minutes he wishes himself at
home, where he never goes but to sleep. On
Thursday he finds out the secret, that he is
heartily sick of doing nothing; but is ashamed
to confess it; and then what is the use of going
to work before his money is spent? On Friday
he swears that he is a fool for throwing away
the greatest part of his quarter’s savings without
having any thing to show for it, and gets gloriously
drunk with the rest to prove his words;
passing the pleasantest night of all the week in
a watch-house. And on Saturday, after thanking
“his Worship” for his good advice, of which he
does not remember a word, he comes to the wise
determination, that, after all, there is nothing
like working all day long in silence, and at
night spending his earnings and his breath in
beer and politics!&mdash;So much for the Easter week
of a London holiday maker.</p>

<p>But there is a sport belonging to Easter Monday
which is not confined to the lower classes; and
which fun forbid that I should pass over silently.
If the reader has not, during his boyhood, performed
the exploit of riding to the Turn-out of
the Stag on Epping Forest&mdash;following the hounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
all day long at a respectful distance&mdash;returning
home in the evening with the loss of nothing but
his hat, his hunting whip, and his horse, not
to mention a portion of his nether person&mdash;and
finishing the day by joining the Lady Mayoress’s
Ball at the Mansion-House; if the reader has
not done all this when a boy, I will not tantalize
him by expiating on the superiority of those who
have. And if he <i>has</i> done it, I need not tell
him that he has no cause to envy his friend who
escaped with a flesh wound from the fight of
Waterloo; for there is not a pin to choose between
them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have little to tell the reader in regard to
London exclusively, this month; which is lucky,
because I have left myself less than no space at
all to tell it in. I must mention, however, that
now is heard in her streets the prettiest of all
the cries which are peculiar to them&mdash;“Come,
buy my Primroses!” and but for which the
Londoners would have no idea that Spring was
at hand.</p>

<p>Now, too, spoiled children make “fools” of
their mammas and papas; which is but fair,
seeing that the said mammas and papas return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
the compliment during all the rest of the year.
Now, not even a sceptical apprentice (for such
there be now-a-days, thanks to the enlightening
effects of universal education) but is religiously
persuaded of the merits of <i>Good</i> Friday, and the
propriety of its being so called, since it procures
him two Sundays in the week instead of one.</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;now, Exhibitions of Paintings court
the public gaze, and obtain it, in every quarter;
on the principle, I suppose, that the eye has, at
this season of the year, a natural hungering and
thirsting after the colours of the Spring leaves
and flowers, and rather than not meet with them
at all, is content to find them on painted canvas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"><br />{87}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MAY" id="MAY"></a>MAY.</h2>

<p>Spring is with us once more, pacing the earth
in all the primal pomp of her beauty, with flowers
and soft airs and the song of birds every where
about her, and the blue sky and the bright
clouds above. But there is one thing wanting,
to give that happy completeness to her advent,
which belonged to it in the elder times; and
without which it is like a beautiful melody without
words, or a beautiful flower without scent,
or a beautiful face without a soul. The voice
of Man is no longer heard, hailing her approach
as she hastens to bless him; and his choral
symphonies no longer meet and bless <i>her</i> in return&mdash;bless
her by letting her behold and hear
the happiness that she comes to create. The
soft songs of women are no longer blended with
her breath as it whispers among the new leaves;
their slender feet no longer trace <i>her</i> footsteps
in the fields and woods and wayside copses, or
dance delighted measures round the flowery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>ferings
that she prompted their lovers to place
before them on the village green. Even the
little children themselves, that have an instinct
for the Spring, and feel it to the very tips of
their fingers, are permitted to let May come
upon them, without knowing from whence the
impulse of happiness that they feel proceeds, or
whither it tends. In short,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All the earth is gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give themselves up to jollity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the heart of May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth every beast keep holiday:”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>while man, man alone, lets the season come
without glorying in it; and when it goes he lets
it go without regret; as if “all seasons and
their change” were alike to him; or rather, as
if he were the lord of all seasons, and they were
to do homage and honour to him, instead of he
to them! How is this? Is it that we have “sold
our birthright for a mess of pottage?”&mdash;that we
have bartered “our being’s end and aim” for a
purse of gold? Alas! thus it is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The world is too much with us; late and soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little we see in nature that is ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have given our hearts away&mdash;a sordid boon!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
And the consequence is, that, if we would know
the true nature of those hearts, and the manner
in which they are adapted to receive and act
upon the impressions that come to them from
external things, we must gain what we seek at
secondhand; we must look into the records that
have been copied from hearts that lived and beat
ages ago; for in our own breasts we shall find
only a blurred and scribbled sheet, or at best
but a blank one. Even among our poets, the
passions, characters, and events growing out of
an over-civilized state of society, have usurped
the place of those primary impulses and impressions
in the susceptibility to receive which
the poetical temperament mainly consists; and
instead of Nature and her works being any longer
the theme of our verse, these are only brought in
as occasional aids and ornaments, to show off,
not <i>man</i> as he essentially is in all time, but <i>men</i>
as they accidentally are in the nineteenth century.
It is true that one of our poets, and he
the greatest, has nearly escaped the polluting
influence of towns and cities. But in doing so,
he has been compelled to take such close shelter
within the citadel of his own heart, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
mental health has somewhat suffered from a
want of due airing and exercise. And this it is
which will, in a great measure, prevent his
works from calling us back to that vigorous and
healthful condition which they otherwise might.
No, even Mr. Wordsworth himself has not been
able, from the loopholes of his retreat, to take
that kind of glance at “man, nature, and society,”
which will enable him so to adapt himself
to our wants as to do more than persuade us
of their existence. To supply or set aside those
wants will demand even a greater than he: unless
indeed (as I fear) we are “hurt past all <i>poetry</i>,”
and must look for a cure to that Nature alone
which we have so long despised and outraged.
But be this as it may, we are still able to <i>feel</i>
what Nature is, though we have in a great measure
ceased to <i>know</i> it; though we have chosen
to neglect her ordinances, and absent ourselves
from her presence, we still retain some instinctive
reminiscences of her beauty and her power; and
every now and then the sordid walls of those
mud hovels which we have built for ourselves,
and choose to dwell in, fall down before the
magic touch of our involuntary fancies, and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
us glimpses into “that imperial palace whence
we came,” and make us yearn to return thither,
though it be but in thought.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Then sing ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And let the young lambs bound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As to the tabor’s sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We <i>in thought</i> will join your throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ye that pipe and ye that play,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ye that through your hearts to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feel the gladness of the <span class="smcap">May</span>!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Meet me, then, gentle reader, here on this
Village Green, and forgetting that there are such
places as cities in the world, let us “do observance
to a morn of May:” we shall find it
almost as pleasant an employment as money-getting
itself! From this spot we can observe
specimens of many of those objects which are
now in their fullest beauty, and which we were
obliged to pass over at our last meeting.</p>

<p>The stately Horse-chestnut is in still greater
perfection than it was last month&mdash;each of its
pyramidal flowers looking like a “picture in
little” of the great American Aloe. The Limes,
too, that shade the lower windows of the Parsonage,
and the Honeysuckles that make a little
bower of its trellised doorway, are now in full
leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
By the sunshine, which falls in bright patches
on this broad walk leading to the Church, we
may observe that the Elms are not as yet in full
leaf; and casting our eyes upward, we shall see,
through the intervals between the thinly spread
leaves, spots of blue sky looking down upon us
like a host of blue eyes. In the little Churchyard
the graves are all covered with a flush of
new green, spotted here and there with Daisies,
which make even them look gay; the Ivy, which
binds together the stones of the old belfry, is
every where putting forth its young shoots; and
the dark Yew itself, that shades the low porch,
feels the influence of the season, and is once more
putting on a look of green old age.</p>

<p>Let us now pass over the little stile that divides
this sadly sweet inclosure from the adjacent
paddock, and make our way into the open fields
beyond. But what is this rich perfume, that
comes floating past us as we go, borne on the
warm breeze like incense? What but the sweet
breath of the Hawthorn, blended (for those who
have organs delicate enough to distinguish it)
with that of the Violet, which grows about its
roots, and steams up its plaintive odours from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
crowd of hidden censers, till they reach the
clouds of sweetness that are hanging above, and
both are borne away together on the wings of
every wind that passes. Those who are not accustomed
to the <i>harmony of scents</i>, and cannot
detect two or three together when they are
blended in this manner, are exactly in the situation
of those who are only susceptible of the
<i>melodies</i> of music, and can hear nothing in
<i>harmony</i> but a <i>single sound</i>.</p>

<p>One of the loveliest objects in the vegetable
kingdom is a fine-grown Hawthorn tree, in the
state in which we meet with it this month.
But they are scarcely ever to be found in the
open country, being of such extremely slow
growth that they require particular advantages
of soil, protection from the depredations of cattle,
&amp;c. before they can be made to reach the state
of <i>a tree</i>. They are seldom to be met with in
this state except in parks and pleasure-grounds;
and even then they require to stand perfectly
alone, or they do not gain that picturesque elegance
of form on which so much of their beauty
depends. There are some, I remember, both
pink and white, in the deer-park of Maudlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
College, that are <i>a sight</i> to look upon. The
extreme beauty of this tree when in blossom
arises partly from the delightful mixture of the
leaves and blossoms together,&mdash;almost all the
other trees that can properly be called <i>flowering</i>
ones putting forth their blossoms before they
have acquired sufficient green leaves to contrast
with and set them off. There is another tree
that we have not yet noticed, the Sycamore, the
effect of which, when it is suffered to grow
singly, is extremely elegant at this season.</p>

<p>Now, too, and not till now, the Oak, the
Walnut, and the Mulberry begin to put forth
their leaves, offering us, even till the commencement
of June, a seeming renewal or lengthening
out of the Spring, when all the rest of the vegetable
world has put on the hues of Summer.
The two first of these, however, have during the
first fortnight of their vegetation the brown and
golden hues of Autumn upon them.</p>

<p>But we must be more brief in our search
after the beauties of May, or we shall not have
space to name the half of them. Let us turn,
then, towards our home inclosures; glancing, as
we pass, at a few more of those sweet sights which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
belong to the fields exclusively. And first let
us feed our eyes with the brilliant green of
yonder Wheat-field. The stems, you see, have
just attained height enough to wave gracefully
in the wind; which, as it passes over them,
seems to convert the whole into a beautiful lake
of bright green undulating water. That Meadow
which adjoins it, glittering all over with yellow
King-cups, is no less bright and beautiful. It
looks like the bed where Jupiter visited Danäe
in a shower of gold. How pretty, too, are these
Cowslips, starting up close beside our path, as if
anxious to be seen, and yet hanging down their
modest heads, as if afraid to meet the gaze that
they seem to court.</p>

<p>We must delay for a moment beside this
pretty Hedgerow, to observe a few more of the
various coloured weeds (so called by those manufacturers
of artificial flowers, the gardeners)
which first put forth their blossoms this month.
Conspicuous is the Campion, rising from the
bank, with its single lake-coloured flowers scattered
aloof from each other, upon their long
bare stems. Among the lower leaves of these,
rising from the ditch below, the Water-violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
rears its elegant head, consisting of rosy clusters
ranged tier above tier, and lessening towards the
top, till they form a flowery pyramid. About
the edges of the banks, low on the ground,
are scattered the Hyacinths in blue profusion,
relieved here and there by the white Cuckoo-flower,
or Lady-smock, the plain, but sweet-scented
Woodruff, and the sunny Dandelion;
while, close beneath the overhanging hedgerow,
the Cuckoo-pint stands motionless in its green
pavilion, and seems to keep watch, like a sentinel,
over the flowery tribe around.</p>

<p>But see! yonder Butterfly, fluttering past us
like a winged flower, reminds us that now come
forth that ephemeral race whose lives are scarcely
of longer date than those of the flowers on whose
aroma they feed.</p>

<p>Now, shoot past us, like winged arrows, or
hover near us like Fairies’ messengers come to
bring us tidings of the Summer, those frail
creatures&mdash;green, and purple, and gold&mdash;borne
on invisible gossamer wings,&mdash;of which the flying
dragons of fairy and of pantomime-land are but
clumsy imitations. Now, blithe companies of
Gnats hum and hover up and down in the warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
air, like motes in a sunbeam. Now, the wayside
Cricket begins to chirrup forth its monotonous
mirth; for ever harping on one note,
and never tiring or growing tired. Now, the
great Humble Bee goes booming along, startling
the pleased ear as he passes; or hurries suddenly
out of the heart of some wayside flower, and
leaves it trembling at his departure, as if a
thought of his distant home had disturbed him
in the midst of his blithe labours. Now, in the
early dusk, the heavy Cockchafer hums drowsily
along, or flurs from out some near lime-tree,
and flings his mailed form (as if on purpose)
into the face of the startled passenger. Now, at
night, the Glow-worm shows her bright love-lamp
to her distant mate, as he floats in the dim
air above; and, seeing it, he closes his thin
wings about him, and drops down to her side.</p>

<p>Now, the most active and industrious of all
the smaller birds, the Swallow tribe, begin to
devote themselves seriously to the business of
the season. They have hitherto, since their
first appearance, been sporting about in seeming
idleness. But without this needful exercise and
relaxation they would not be fit to go through
the henceforth unceasing toils of the Summer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
for they have two or three broods to bring up
before they retire, each of which, when hatched,
requires the incessant toil of the parents from
light till dark, to provide them food,&mdash;so dainty
and delicate are they in the choice of it. Now,
during this month, they begin and complete
their dwellings; the House-swallow in the shafts
of chimneys, thus providing their young at once
with warmth and safety; the confiding Martin
in the windows, and under the eaves, of our
houses; and the Swift within the clefts of castles
and other high old buildings, where “the air is
delicate.”</p>

<p>Finally, now many of the earlier builders are
<i>sitting</i>, and some few have hatched their broods.
Let those who would contemplate, in imagination,
the most perfect state of tranquil happiness
of which a sentient being is susceptible, gaze
(still in imagination, for actual sight would break
the spell for both parties) on the mother bird,
breasting her warm eggs beneath the shade of
some retired covert, while her vocal lover (made
vocal by his love) sits on some near bough
beside, and pours into her listening heart the
joy that <i>will</i> not be contained within his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
In the Garden we now find all the promises of
April completed, and a host of others springing
up, to be fulfilled in their turn during the rest of
the season. But May, notwithstanding its reputation
in this particular, is not to be considered
as, <i>par excellence</i>, the Month of Flowers, at
least in this climate, and in respect to those
flowers which have now become exclusively
garden ones: though of <i>wild</i> flowers, and of
blossoms which are afterwards to produce fruit,
it is the month. Of the annuals, for instance,
which make so rich a show in common gardens,
(and it is of those alone that these unexotic
pages profess to speak), none flower in May; but
all of them mix up their many-shaded greens,
and contrast their various shaped forms, with
those that do. Among these latter are, in addition
to those of last month which still continue
in blow, the rich-scented Wall-flower; the flower
of as many names as colours, the prettiest of
which is taken from that feeling which the sight
of it gives&mdash;Heart’s-ease; Crown-imperial; Lily
of the Valley, most delicate of all the vegetable
tribe, both in shape and odour,&mdash;its bright little
illumination-lamps looking out meekly from their
pavilions of emerald green; the towering, blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
Monk’s-hood; the pretty but foreign-looking
Fritillary, or Snake’s-head, as it is more appropriately
called, from its shape and colours;
and sometimes, when the season is unfavourably
favourable, the Rose herself. But her and her
attractions we must leave till they come upon us
in showers, in her <i>own</i> month of June.</p>

<p>Among the flowering shrubs we have now,
also, many which demand their Spring welcome.
And first the Lilac; for it was scarcely in full
bloom last month; and it is its rich fulness
that constitutes much of its charm, though its
scent is delightful. Now, too, the Guelder-rose
flings up its spheres of white light into the air,
supported on their invisible stems, and looking,
as the wind blows them about, like the jugglers’
balls chasing each other as if in sport. The
Mountain-ash, too, puts forth its fans of white
blossom, which the imagination converts, as soon
as they appear, into those rich bunches of scarlet
berries that make the winter months look gay;
and which said “imagination” would do the
same by the Elder-bloom, which also now appears,
but that its delicious odour, when scented
at a sufficient distance from its source, tells tales
of any thing but winter and elder-wine. Lastly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
the Laburnum now hangs forth its golden glories,
and shows itself, for a few brief days, the most
graceful of all the inhabitants of the shrubbery.
The blossoms of the Laburnum, where they are
seen from a little distance, and have (from circumstances
of soil, &amp;c.) acquired their due dependent
posture, can scarcely be looked at
steadily without a seeming <i>motion</i> being communicated
to them, as if some invisible hand
had detached them from their stems, and they
were in the act of falling to the earth in the
form of a yellow rain.</p>

<p>In the orchard, the loveliest of all fruit-blossoms,
the Apples, are now in full perfection.
These flowers are scarcely ever examined or
praised for their beauty; and yet they are
formed of almost every other flower’s best.
They are as fresh as the Rose, and more delicate;
as innocent as the Vale Lily, and more
gay; as modest as the Daisy, and less prim.
And surely they are not the worse for being
followed by a beautiful fruit; any more than a
beautiful bride is the worse for being a rich one.
I have been “cudgelling my brains” (which, to
speak the truth, I am seldom called upon to do)
for a likeness to this lovely blossom; and I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
find none but that which I have used already.
The Apple-blossom is like nothing, in nature or
in art, but the Countess of B&mdash;&mdash;’s face; which
is itself not wholly in either, being a happy
mixture of the best parts of both&mdash;the sweet
simplicity of the one, and the finished grace of
the other; and which&mdash;but I beseech her to
take it away from before my imagination at
once, if she has any desire to see these pleasant
papers come to a conclusion; for if it should
again open upon me from among the flowers,
like Cupid’s from out the Rose, I cannot answer
for the consequences on the remainder of this
history; for, though I am able to find in the
Apple-blossom no likeness to any thing but <i>her</i>
face, if once I am put upon pointing out resemblances
in <i>that</i>, it shall go hard but I will
prove it to be, in some particular or other, the
prototype of all beautiful things,&mdash;always excepting
Sir Thomas’s portrait of her; which,
however <i>she</i> may be like <i>it</i>, is <i>not like her</i>. Her
face is like&mdash;</p>

But hold!&mdash;if my readers, in consideration of
the brief limits which confine me, are not to be
treated with other people’s poetry, they shall,
at least, not be troubled with mine; to which
end I must bid adieu to the abovenamed face,
once and for ever.</p>

<p>We may now quit the garden for this month;
though it would be ungrateful to do so without
condescending to take one glance at that portion
of it which is to supply our more substantial
wants. Now, then, the Kitchen-garden is in its
best trim, its orderly inhabitants having all put
on their Spring liveries, and their sprightliest
looks, but not being yet sufficiently advanced in
growth to call down that havoc which will soon
be at work among them. We must not venture
into detail here; though the real lover of the
Garden (unless he affects the <i>genteel</i>) would
scarcely be angry with us if we did. But we
may notice, in passing, the first fruits of the
year&mdash;Gooseberries and Currants; the successive
crops of Peas and Beans, “each under each,”
the earliest just getting into bloom; green lines
of Lettuces, so spruce and orderly, that it seems
a pity ever to break them; (ditto of Cabbages
we of course utterly exclude, seeing that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
things were never heard of in the polite purlieus
of Piccadilly;) Melon and Cucumber frames,
glittering in the bright light, and half open, to
admit the morning visits of the sun and air. In
short, a flower-garden itself is but half complete,
if we cannot step out of it at pleasure into the
kitchen one, on the other side of the green screen
or the fruit-clothed wall that bounds it.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Must we, after all this pleasant expatiation
among the natural delights of May, repair to
the metropolis, and see whether there is any
thing worthy of remark among the artificial
ones? I suppose we must; for it is mid-winter
in London now, and the fashionable season is at
its height. But we must not be expected to
look about us there in the best possible humour,
after having left the flowers and the sunshine
behind us. We will, at all events, contrive to
reach London on May-day, that we may not
lose the only relic that is left us of the sports
which were once as natural to this period as the
opening of the leaves or the springing of the
grass. I mean the gloomy merriment of Jack
in the Green, and the sad hilarity of the chimney-sweepers.
This is, indeed, a melancholy affair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
contrasted with what that must have been of
which it reminds us. The effect of it, to the
bystanders, is like that of a wobegone ballad-singer
chanting a merry stave. It is good as
far as it goes, nevertheless; inasmuch as it procures
a holiday, such as it is, for those who
would not otherwise know the meaning of the
phrase. The wretched imps, whose mops and
mowes produce the mock merriment in question,
are the <i>parias</i> of their kind; outcasts from the
society even of their equals, the very charity-boys
give themselves airs of patronage in their
presence; and the little beggar’s brat, that leads
his blind father along the streets, would scorn
to be seen playing at chuck-farthing with them.
But even they, on May-day, feel themselves
somebody; for the rout of ragged urchins, that
turned up their noses at them yesterday, will
to-day dog their footsteps with admiring shouts,
and, such is the love of momentary distinction,
would not disdain to own an acquaintance with
them. Nay, some of them are trying, even now,
to recollect whether it was not with that young
gentleman, in the gilt jacket and gauze trowsers,
that they had the honour of playing at marbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
“on Wednesday last.” There was not a man
in the crowd, when Jack Thurtell was hanged,
that would not have been proud of a nod from
him on the scaffold.</p>

<p>Now, on the first day, the hats of the Hammersmith
coachmen grow progressively heavy,
and their heads light, with the “favours” they
receive from the barmaids of the fifteen public-houses
at which they regularly stop to refresh
themselves between Kensington Gravel Pits and
Saint Paul’s.</p>

<p>Now, the winter being fairly set in, London
is full of life; and Bond-street seems an enviable
spot in the eyes of coach-makers, and cavalry
officers on duty.</p>

<p>Now, the innocent inhabitants of May-fair
wonder what the people in the street can mean
by disturbing them at six in the morning, just
as they are getting to sleep, by crying, “come
buy my nice bow-pots!” not having any notion
that there are natural flowers “in the midst of
winter!”</p>

<p>Now, the Benefits have began at the winter
theatres, and consequently all “genteel” persons
have left off going there; seeing that the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
attraction offered on those occasions is a double
portion of amusement: as if any body went to
the theatre for <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>Now, the high fashionables, for once in the
year, permit their horses’ hoofs to honour the
stones of the Strand by striking fire out of
them; and, what is still more unaccountable,
they permit plebeian shawls and shoulders to
come in contact with theirs, on the stairs of
Somerset House. And all to encourage the
Arts! That their own portraits, by Sir Thomas,
are among the number of the works exhibited,
cannot for a moment be considered as the moving
cause at such marvellous condescension.</p>

<p>Now, too, flowing through the Strand in opposite
directions towards the same spot, may be
seen, on fine days of the first fortnight, two
streams of white muslin, on which flowers are
floating, and which form a confluence at the gates
of the Academy, and ascending the winding staircase
together (which streams are seldom in the
habit of doing), presently disperse themselves
into a lake at the top of the building, which
glows with as many colours as that on the top
of Mount Cenis.</p>

<p>Now, too, still on the same spot, may be seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
peering half shamefacedly in the purlieus of his
own picture, some anxious young artist, watching
intently for those scraps of criticism which
the newspapers have as yet withheld from him
(but which will doubtless appear in <i>tomorrow’s</i>
report); and believing, from the bottom of his
soul, that the young lady, aged twelve years,
who has just fetched her mamma to admire <i>his</i>
production, is the best judge in the room; which,
considering that he is a reasonable person, and
nowise prejudiced, is more than he can account
for in one so young!</p>

<p>Now, an occasional butterfly is seen fluttering
away over the heads of the pale pedestrians of
Ludgate Hill, who wonder what it can portend.
Now, country cousins pay their triennial visits to
the sights of London; and having been happy
enough to secure lodgings in a side street in the
Strand, have no doubt whatever that they are
living at the west end of the town. Accordingly,
they perambulate Parliament-street with exemplary
perseverance, and then return to the country,
to tell tales of the fashionables they have
seen.</p>

<p>Finally, now the Parks really are the pleasantest
imitations of the country that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
met with away from it. That of Hyde is worth
walking in at five on a fine week-day, if it be
only to see how the footmen and the horses enjoy
themselves; and still more so at four on a fine
Sunday, to see how the citizens do the same.
The Green Park, in virtue of the youths and
maidens who meander about it in all directions
on the latter day, looks, at a distance, like
a meadow strewn all over with moving wild-flowers.
And the great alley in Kensington
Gardens, when the fashionables please to patronise
it, is as pretty to look down upon, from
the Pavilion at top, as one of Watteau’s pictures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"><br />{111}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JUNE" id="JUNE"></a>JUNE.</h2>

<p>Summer is come&mdash;come, but not to stay; at
least, not at the commencement of this month.
And how should it, unless we expect that the
seasons will be kind enough to conform to the
devices of man, and suffer themselves to be called
by what name and at what period <i>he</i> pleases?
He must die and leave them a legacy (instead
of they him) before there will be any show of
justice in this. Till then the beginning of June
will continue to be the latter end of May, by
rights; as it was according to the <i>old style</i>. And,
among a thousand changes, in what one has the
old style been improved upon by the new?
Assuredly not in that of substituting the <i>utile</i>
for the <i>dulce</i>, in any eyes but those of almanack
makers. Let all lovers of Spring, therefore, be
fully persuaded that, for the first fortnight in
June, they are living in May; and then, all the
sweet truths that I had to tell of the latter month,
are equally applicable to half the present. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
shall thus be gaining instead of losing, after all,
by the impertinence of any breath, but that of
Heaven, attempting to force Spring into Summer,
even in name alone.</p>

<p>Spring, therefore, may now be considered as
employed in completing her toilet, and, for the
first weeks of this month, putting on those last
finishing touches which an accomplished beauty
never trusts to any hand but her own. In the
woods and groves also, she is still clothing some
of her noblest and proudest attendants with their
new annual attire. The oak until now has been
nearly bare; and, of whatever age, has been
looking old all the Winter and Spring, on account
of its crumpled branches and wrinkled
rind. Now, of whatever age, it looks young, in
virtue of its new green, lighter than all the rest
of the grove. Now, also, the stately Walnut
(standing singly or in pairs in the fore-court of
ancient manor-houses; or in the home corner of
the pretty park-like paddock at the back of some
modern Italian villa, whose white dome it saw
rise beneath it the other day, and mistakes for a
mushroom), puts forth its smooth leaves slowly,
as “sage grave men” do their thoughts; and
which over-caution reconciles one to the beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
it receives in the autumn, as the best means of
at once compassing its present fruit, and making
it bear more; as its said prototypes in animated
nature are obliged to have their brains cudgelled,
before any good can be got from them.</p>

<p>Among the ornamental trees, the only one
that is not as yet clothed in all its beauty is, the
most beautiful of all&mdash;the white Acacia. Its trim
taper leaves are but just spreading themselves
forth to welcome the coming summer sun; as
those pretty female fingers which they resemble
are spread involuntarily at the approach of the
accepted lover.</p>

<p>The Mulberry, too, which in this country
never sees itself unprovided with a smooth-shaven
carpet of green turf beneath it, on which to drop
(without injuring) its tender fruit, is only now
rousing itself from its late repose. Its appearance
is at present as poverty-stricken, in comparison
with most of its well-dressed companions,
as six weeks hence it will be rich, full, and
umbrageous.</p>

<p>These are the chief appearances of the early
part of this month which appertain exclusively
to the Spring. Let us now (however reluctantly)
take a final leave of that lovely and love-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
season, and at once step forward into the glowing
presence of Summer&mdash;contenting ourselves, however,
to touch the hem of her rich garments, and
not attempting to look into her heart, till she lays
that open to us herself next month: for whatever
school-boys calendar-makers may say to the
contrary, Midsummer never happens in England
till July.</p>

<p>The most appropriate spots in which first to
watch the footsteps of Summer are amid “the
pomp of Groves, and garniture of Fields.” There
let us seek her, then.</p>

<p>To saunter, at mid June, beneath the shade of
some old forest, situated in the neighbourhood of
a great town, so that paths are worn through
it, and you can make your way with ease in any
direction, gives one the idea of being transferred,
by some strange magic, from the surface of the
earth to the bottom of the sea! (I say it gives
<i>one</i> this idea; for I cannot answer for more, in
matters of so arbitrary a nature as the association
of ideas). Over head, and round about, you hear
the sighing, the whispering, or the roaring (as
the wind pleases) of a thousand billows; and
looking upward, you see the light of heaven
transmitted faintly, as if through a mass of green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
waters. Hither and thither, as you move along,
strange forms flit swiftly about you, which may,
for any thing you can see or hear to the contrary,
be exclusive natives of the new world in which
your fancy chooses to find itself: they may be
<i>fishes</i>, if that pleases; for they are as mute as such,
and glide through the liquid element as swiftly.
Now and then, indeed, one of larger growth, and
less lubricated movements, lumbers up from beside
your path, and cluttering noisily away to
a little distance, may chance to scare for a moment
your sub-marine reverie. Your palate too
may perhaps here step in, and try to persuade
you that the cause of interruption was not a fish
but a pheasant. But in fact, if your fancy is
one of those which are disposed to “listen to
reason,” it will not be able to lead you into spots
of the above kind without your gun in your
hand,&mdash;one report of which will put all fancies
to flight in a moment, as well as every thing else
that has wings. To return, therefore, to our
walk,&mdash;what do all these strange objects look
like, that stand silently about us in the dim twilight,
some spiring straight up, and tapering as
they ascend, till they lose themselves in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
green waters above&mdash;some shattered and splintered,
leaning against each other for support, or
lying heavily on the floor on which we walk&mdash;some
half buried in that floor, as if they had
lain dead there for ages, and become incorporate
with it; what do all these seem, but wrecks and
fragments of some mighty vessel, that has sunk
down here from above, and lain weltering and
wasting away, till these are all that is left of it!
Even the floor itself on which we stand, and the
vegetation it puts forth, are unlike those of any
other portion of the earth’s surface, and may
well recall, by their strange appearance in the
half light, the fancies that have come upon us
when we have read or dreamt of those gifted
beings, who, like Ladurlad in Kehama, could
walk on the floor of the sea, without waiting,
as the visitors at Watering-places are obliged to
do, for the tide to go out.</p>

<p>“But why,” exclaims the reasonable reader,
“detain us, at a time of year like this, among
fancies and associations, when facts and realities
a thousand times more lovely are waiting to be
recorded?” He is right, and I bow to the
reproof; only I must escape at once from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
old Forest into which I had inadvertently wandered;
for <i>there</i> I shall not be able to remain a
moment fancy-free.</p>

<p>Stepping forth, then, into the open fields,
what a bright pageant of Summer beauty is
spread out before us! We are standing, you
perceive, on a little eminence, every point of
which presents some particular offering of the
season, and from which we can also look abroad
upon those which require a more distant and
general gaze. Everywhere about our feet flocks
of Wild-Flowers</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Do paint the meadow with delight.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We must not stay to pluck and particularize
them; for most of them have already had their
greeting from us in the two preceding months;
and though they insist on repeating themselves
during this, they must not expect us to do the
same, to the exclusion of others whose claims are
newer and not less noticeable. That we may
duly attend to these latter, let us pass along
beside this flourishing Hedge-row, that skirts the
Wood from which we have just emerged.</p>

<p>The first novelty of the Season that greets us
here is perhaps the sweetest, the freshest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
fairest of all, and the only one that could supply
an adequate substitute for the Hawthorn bloom
which it has superseded. Need the Eglantine
be named? the “sweet-leaved Eglantine;” the
“rain-scented Eglantine;” Eglantine&mdash;to which
the Sun himself pays homage, by “counting
his dewy rosary” on it every morning; Eglantine&mdash;which
Chaucer, and even Shakespeare&mdash;but
hold&mdash;let me again insist on the Poets not
being permitted to set their feet even within
the porticos of these pleasant papers; for if once
they do, good bye to the control of the rightful
owner! I did but invite Mr. Wordsworth in, two
months ago, as the reader may remember, just
to say a few words in favour of the Daisy, in
pure gratitude for his having made it a sort of
sin to tread on one,&mdash;and lo! there was no getting
him out again, till he had poured forth two
or three pages full of stanzas, touching that one
“wee, modest, crimson-tipped Flower!” Besides,
what need have we for the aid of Poets (I mean
<i>the</i> Poets, so called <i>par excellence</i>) when in the
actual presence of that Nature which made <i>them</i>
such, and can make <i>us</i> such too, if any thing
can. In fact, whatsoever the Poets themselves
may insinuate to the contrary, to read poetry in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
the presence of Nature is a kind of impiety:
it is like reading the commentators on Shakespeare,
and skipping the text; for you cannot
attend to both; to say nothing of Nature’s book
being a <i>vade mecum</i> that can make “every man
his own poet” for the time being; and there is,
after all, no poetry like that which we create for
ourselves. Away, then, with the Poets by profession&mdash;at
least till the winter comes, and we
want them.</p>

<p>Begging pardon of the Eglantine for having
permitted any thing&mdash;even her own likeness in
the Poets’ looking-glass&mdash;to turn our attention
from her real self,&mdash;look with what infinite grace
she scatters her sweet coronals here and there
among her bending branches; or hangs them,
half-concealed, among the heavy blossoms of the
Woodbine that lifts itself so boldly above her,
after having first clung to <i>her</i> for support; or
permits them to peep out here and there close
to the ground, and almost hidden by the rank
weeds below; or holds out a whole arch-way
of them, swaying backward and forward in the
breeze, as if praying of the passers hand to pluck
them. Let who will praise the Hawthorn&mdash;now
it is no more! The Wild Rose is the Queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
Forest Flowers, if it be only because she is as
unlike a Queen as the absence of every thing
courtly can make her.</p>

<p>The Woodbine deserves to be held next in
favour during this month; though more on account
of its <i>intellectual</i> than its personal beauty.
All the air is faint with its rich sweetness; and
the delicate breath of its lovely rival is lost in
the luscious odours which it exhales.</p>

<p>These are the only <i>scented</i> Wild Flowers that
we shall now meet with in any profusion; for
though the Violet may still be found by looking
for, its breath has lost much of its spring power.
But if we are content with mere beauty, this
month is perhaps more profuse of it than any
other, even in that department of Nature which
we are now examining&mdash;namely, the Fields and
Woods. The rich hedge-row from which we
have just been plucking the Eglantine and the
Wild Honeysuckle is fringed all along its borders,
and festooned in every part, with gay
clusters, some of which appeared for the first
time last month, and continue through this,
and with numerous others which now first come
forth. Most conspicuous among the latter are
the brilliant Hound’s tongue; the striped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
variegated Convolvulus; the Wild Scabious, pale
and scentless sister of the rich garden one; the
Ox-eye, or Great White Daisy, looking, with its
yellow centre surrounded by white beams, like
the miniature original of the Sun on country
sign-posts; the Mallow, that supplies the little
children with <i>cheeses</i>; and two or three of the
almost animated Orchises, particularly the Bee-Orchis,&mdash;which
escapes being rifled of its sweets
by that general plunderer who gives his name
to it, by always seeming to be pre-occupied.</p>

<p>Before quitting the little elevation on which
we have commenced our observations, we must
take a brief general glance at the various masses
of objects that it brings within our view. The
Woods and Groves, and the single Forest Trees
that rise here and there from out the bounding
Hedge-rows, are now in full foliage; all, however,
presenting a somewhat sombre, because
monotonous, hue, wanting all the tender newness
of the Spring, and all the rich variety of the
Autumn. And this is the more observable, because
the numerous plots of cultivated land, divided
from each other by the hedge-rows, and
looking, at this distance, like beds in a garden
divided by box, are nearly all still invested with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
the same green mantle; for the Wheat, the Oats,
the Barley, and even the early Rye, though now
in full flower, have not yet become tinged with
their harvest hues. They are all alike green;
and the only change that can be seen in their
appearance is that caused by the different lights
into which each is thrown, as the wind passes
over them. The patches of purple or of white
Clover that intervene here and there, and are
now in flower, offer striking exceptions to the
above, and at the same time load the air with
their sweetness. Nothing can be more rich and
beautiful in its effect on a distant prospect at
this season, than a great patch of purple Clover
lying apparently motionless on a sunny upland,
encompassed by a whole sea of green Corn,
waving and shifting about it at every breath that
blows.</p>

<p>Before quitting this Wood-side, let us observe
that the hitherto full concert of the singing birds
is now beginning to falter, and fall short. We
shall do well to make the most of it now; for in
two or three weeks it will almost entirely cease
till the Autumn. I mean that it will cease as a
full concert; for we shall have single songsters
all through the Summer at intervals; and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
some of the sweetest and best. The best of all,
indeed, the Nightingale, we have now lost. It
is never to be heard for more than two months
in this country, and never at all after the young
are hatched, which happens about this time. So
that the youths and maidens who now go in
pairs to the Wood-side, on warm nights, to listen
for its song (hoping they may <i>not</i> hear it), are
well content to hear each other’s voice instead.</p>

<p>We have still, however, some of the finest of
the second class of songsters left; for the Nightingale,
like Catalani, is a class by itself. The
mere chorus-singers of the Grove are also beginning
to be silent; so that the <i>jubilate</i> that
has been chanting for the last month is now
over. But the Stephenses, the Trees, the Patons,
and the Poveys, are still with us, under
the forms of the Woodlark, the Skylark, the
Blackcap, and the Goldfinch. And the first-named
of these, now that it no longer fears the
rivalry of the unrivalled, not seldom, on warm
nights, sings at intervals all night long, poised
at one spot high up in the soft moonlit air.</p>

<p>We have still another pleasant little singer,
the Field Cricket, whose clear shrill voice the
warm weather has now matured to its full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
strength, and who must not be forgotten, though
he has but one song to offer us all his life long,
and that one consisting but of one note; for it
is a note of joy, and <i>will</i> not be heard without
engendering its like. You may hear him in
wayside banks, where the Sun falls hot, shrilling
out his loud cry into the still air all day long, as
he sits at the mouth of his cell; and if you
chance to be passing by the same spot at midnight,
you may hear it then too.</p>

<p>We must now make our way towards home,
noticing a few of the remaining marks of mid-June
as we pass along. Now, then, in covert
Copses, or on the skirts of dark Woods, the
Foxglove rears its one splendid spire of speckled
flowers from the centre of its cone of dull, down-hanging
leaves.&mdash;Now, scarlet Poppies peer up
here and there in bright companies among the
green shafts of the Corn, and scatter beauty over
the mischief they do.&mdash;Now, Bees and little boys
banquet on the honey-laden flowers of the white
Hedge-nettle.&mdash;Now, the Brooms put forth their
gold and silver blossoms on hitherto barren
Heaths, and change them into beauteous gardens.&mdash;Now,
whole fields of Peas send out their
winged blossoms, which look like flocks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
purple and white butterflies basking in the sun.&mdash;Now,
too, the Bean, which has little or no
perceptible scent when gathered and smelt to
singly, growing together in fields breathes forth
the most enchanting odour,&mdash;only to be come at,
however, by the wind, which bears and spreads
it half over the adjacent plains.</p>

<p>Now, also, we meet with several new objects
among the animated part of the creation, a few
only of which we must stay to notice.&mdash;Now,
the Grasshopper vaults merrily in the meadows,
leaping over the tops of their mountains (the
molehills), and fancying himself a bird.&mdash;Now,
the great Dragon-flies shoot with their shining
wings through the air, as if bearing some fairy
to its distant bower; or hover, apparently motion
and motiveless, as if they had forgotten their
way, or were waiting to look at some invisible
direction-post. We had best not inquire too
curiously into their employment at those moments,
lest we should find that they are only stopping
to take a bait, consisting of some beautiful
invisible that had just began to enjoy its age of
half an hour.&mdash;Now, lastly, as the Sun declines,
may be seen, emerging from the surface of
shallow streams, and lying there for a while till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
its wings are dried for flight, the (misnamed)
<i>May</i>-fly. Escaping, after a protracted struggle
of half a minute, from its watery birth-place, it
flutters restlessly, up and down, up and down,
over the same spot, during its whole era of a
summer evening; and at last dies, as the last
dying streaks of day are leaving the western
horizon. And yet, who shall say that in that
space of time it has not undergone all the vicissitudes
of a long and eventful life? That it has
not felt all the freshness of youth, all the vigour
of maturity, all the weakness and satiety of old
age, and all the pangs of death itself? In short,
who shall satisfy us that any essential difference
exists between <i>its</i> four hours and <i>our</i> fourscore
years?</p>

<p>Before entering the home inclosure, we must
pay due honour to the two grand husbandry
occupations of this month; the Hay-harvest, and
the Sheep-shearing.</p>

<p>The Hay-harvest, besides filling the whole air
with its sweetness, is even more picturesque in
the appearances it offers, as well as more pleasant
in the associations it calls forth, than <i>the</i> Harvest
in Autumn. What a delightful succession of
pictures it presents! First, the Mowers, stoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>ing
over their scythes, and moving with measured
paces through the early morning mists, interrupted
at intervals by the freshening music of
the whetstone.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;blithe companies of both sexes, ranged
in regular array, and moving lengthwise and
across the Meadow, each with the same action,
and the ridges rising or disappearing behind
them as they go:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There are forty <i>moving</i> like one.”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then again, when the fragrant crop is nearly
fit to be gathered in, and lies piled up in dusky-coloured
hillocks upon the yellow sward, while
here and there, beneath the shade of a “hedgerow
elm,” or braving the open sunshine in the
centre of the scene, sunburnt Groups are seated
in circles at their noonday meal, enjoying that
ease which nothing but labour can generate.</p>

<p>And lastly, when Man and Nature, mutually
assisting each other, have completed the work
of preparation, and the cart stands still to receive
its last forkfull; while the horse, almost hidden
beneath his apparently overwhelming load, lifts
up his patient head sideways to pick a mouthful;
and all about stand the labourers, leaning listlessly
on their implements, and eyeing the completion
of their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
What sweet pastoral pictures are here! The
last, in particular, is prettier to look upon than
any thing else, not excepting one of Wouvermann’s
imitations of it.</p>

<p>Sheep-shearing, the other great rural labour
of this delightful month, if not so full of variety
as the Hay-harvest, and so creative of matter for
those “in search of the picturesque” (though it is
scarcely less so), is still more lively, animated, and
spirit-stirring; and it besides retains something
of the character of a Rural Holiday,&mdash;which rural
matters need, in this age and in this country, more
than ever they did since it became a civilized and
happy one. The Sheep-shearings are the only
<i>stated</i> periods of the year at which we hear of
festivities, and gatherings together of the lovers
and practisers of English husbandry; for even
the Harvest-home itself is fast sinking into disuse,
as a scene of mirth and revelry, from the
want of being duly encouraged and partaken in
by the great ones of the Earth; without whose
countenance and example it is questionable whether
eating, drinking, and sleeping, would not
soon become vulgar practices, and be discontinued
accordingly! In a state of things like
this, the Holkham and Woburn Sheep-shearings
do more honour to their promoters than all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
wealth can purchase and all their titles convey.
But we are getting beyond our soundings:
honours, titles, and “states of things,” are what
we do not pretend to meddle with, especially
when the pretty sights and sounds preparatory
to and attendant on Sheep-shearing, as a mere
rural employment, are waiting to be noticed.</p>

<p>Now, then, on the first really summer’s day,
the whole Flock being collected on the higher
bank of the pool formed at the abrupt winding
of the nameless mill-stream, at the point perhaps
where the little wooden bridge runs slantwise
across it, and the attendants being stationed
waist-deep in the midwater, the Sheep are, after
a silent but obstinate struggle or two, plunged
headlong, one by one, from the precipitous bank;
when, after a moment of confused splashing, their
heavy fleeces float them along, and their feet,
moving by an instinctive art which every creature
but man possesses, guide them towards the opposite
shallows, that steam and glitter in the
sunshine. Midway, however, they are fain to
submit to the rude grasp of the relentless
washer; which they undergo with as ill a grace
as preparatory-schoolboys do the same operation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
Then, gaining the opposite shore heavily, they
stand for a moment till the weight of water
leaves them, and, shaking their streaming sides,
go bleating away towards their fellows on the adjacent
green, wondering within themselves what
has happened.</p>

<p>The Shearing is no less lively and picturesque,
and no less attended by all the idlers of the
Village as spectators. The Shearers, seated in
rows beside the crowded pens, with the seemingly
inanimate load of fleece in their laps, and
bending intently over their work; the occasional
whetting and clapping of the shears; the neatly
attired housewives, waiting to receive the fleeces;
the smoke from the tar-kettle, ascending through
the clear air; the shorn Sheep escaping, one by
one, from their temporary bondage, and trotting
away towards their distant brethren, bleating all
the while for their Lambs, that do not know
them;&mdash;all this, with its ground of universal
green, and finished every where by its leafy
distances, except where the village spire intervenes,
forms together a living picture, pleasanter
to look upon than words can speak, but still
pleasanter to think of when <i>that</i> is the nearest
approach you can make to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
We must now betake ourselves to the Garden,
which I have perhaps kept aloof from longer
than I ought, from something like a fear that
the flush of beauty we shall meet there will go
near to infringe upon that perfect sobriety of
style on which these papers so much pique themselves,
and which, I hope, has not hitherto been
departed from! What may happen now, however,
is more than I shall venture to anticipate.
If, therefore, in passing across yonder smooth
elastic Turf, now in its fullest perfection, and
making our way towards the Flower-plots that
are imbedded in it, my imagination should imbibe
some of the occasionally undue warmth of
the season, and my fancy find itself “half in a
blush of clustering roses lost,” and these should
together engender a style as flowery as the subject
about which it is to concern itself, the
reader will be good enough to bear in mind, that
even the Berecinian blood of an Irish Barrister
can scarcely be made to keep within due bounds,
when he has a beauty for his client! nay, that
even <i>the</i> Irish Barrister <i>par excellence</i> is sometimes
misled into a metaphor, and inveigled into
an allitteration, when his theme happens to be
more than ordinarily inspiring!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
As the Wild Rose is the reigning belle of the
Forest during this Month, so <i>the</i> Rose occupies
a similar rank in the more courtly realm of the
Garden; and the latter is to her sweet relative
of the Woods what the centre of the court circle
in town (whoever she may be) is to the <i>Cynosure</i>
of a country village. Here, in these oval clumps,
which she has usurped entirely to herself, we
find her greeting us under a host of different
forms at the same time, all of which are her own,
all unlike each other, and yet each and all more
lovely than all the rest! I must be content merely
to call by name upon a few of the principal of
these “fair varieties,” and allow their prototypes
in the reader’s imagination to answer for themselves;
for the Poets, those purloiners of all
public property that is worth possessing, have
long precluded us plain prosers from being epithetical
in regard to Roses, without incurring the
imputation of borrowing that from <i>them</i>, which
<i>they</i> first borrowed from their betters, the Roses
themselves.</p>

<p>What, then, can be more enchanting to look
upon than this newly-opened Rose of Provence,
looking upward half shamefacedly from its fragile
stem, as if just awakened from a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
dream to a happier reality? It is the loveliest
Rose we have, and the sweetest&mdash;<i>except</i> this by
its side, the Rose-unique, which looks like the
image of the other cut in marble&mdash;the statue of
the Venus de’ Medici beside the living beauty
that stood as its model. <i>This</i>, surely, <i>is</i> the
loveliest of all Roses&mdash;<i>except</i> the White Blush-Rose,
that rises here in the centre of the group,
and looks like the marble image of the two
former, just as the enamoured gaze of its Pygmalion
has warmed it into life. You see, its
delicate lips are just becoming tinged with the
hues of vitality; and it <i>breathes</i> already, as all
the air about it bears witness. Undoubtedly
<i>this</i> is the loveliest of Roses&mdash;<i>except</i> the Moss
Rose that hangs flauntingly beside it, seemingly
the most careless, but in reality the most coquettish
of court beauties; apparently the sport
of every coxcomb Zephyr that passes, but in
truth indifferent to all but her own sweet self;
and if more modest in her attire than all other
of her fair sisterhood, only adopting this particular
mode because it makes her look more
pretty and piquant. Her “close-fit cap of green,”
the fashion of which she never changes, has ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>actly
that <i>becoming</i> effect on her face which a
French <i>blonde</i> trimming has on the face of an
English <i>londe</i> beauty. But I must refrain from
further details, touching the attractions of the
Rose family, or I shall inevitably lose my credit
with all of them, by discovering some reason why
each, as it comes before me, is without exception
preferable to all the rest. And, in fact, without
wishing to be personal in regard to any, I must
insist that, philosophically speaking, that Rose
which is nearest at hand <i>is</i>, without exception,
the best of Roses, in relation to the person
affected by it; and that even the gaudy Damask,
and the intense velvet-leaved Tuscan (each of
which, in its own particular ear be it said, is
handsomer than any of the beforenamed), must
yield in beauty to the pretty little innocent
blossoms of the Sweet-briar Rose itself, when
none but that is by.</p>

<p>I am afraid the other Garden Flowers, that
first appear in June, must go without their fair
proportion of praise, since they <i>will</i> risk a rivalry
with the unrivalled. They must be content with
a passing “now” of recognition. Now, then,
the flaring Peony throws up its splendid globes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
of crimson and blush-colour from out its rich
domelike pavilion of dark leaves.&mdash;Now, the elegant
yet exotic-looking family of the Amaranths
begin to put on their fantastical attire of fans,
feathers, and fringes. Those, however, which give
name to the tribe, the truly <i>Amaranthine</i>, or Everlasting
ones, are not yet come; nor that other,
most elegant and pathetic of them all, which is
known by the name of Love-lies-bleeding.</p>

<p>Now, the Ranunculus tribe begin to scatter
about their many-coloured balls of brilliant light.
The Persian ones, when planted in beds, with
their infinite varieties of tint and penciling, and
their hundred leaves, lapped over each other
with such inimitable art, eclipse all the Tulips
of the Spring, and would eclipse their Summer
rivals the Carnations too, but that the latter are
as sweet as they are beautiful.</p>

<p>Now, the delicate Balsams rejoice in the fresh
air which is allowed to blow upon them, and
which, like too tender maidens, they have been
sighing for ever since they came into bloom,
without knowing that one rude breath of it
would have blown them into the grave.</p>

<p>Now, too, the Fuchsia, that most exquisitely
formed of all our flowers, native or exotic, is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
longer confined, like an invalid, to a fixed temperature,
but is permitted to mix with its more
hardy brethren in the open air.</p>

<p>Now, also, the whole tribe of Geraniums get
leave of absence from their winter barracks, and
are allowed to keep guard on each side the hall-door,
in their gay regimentals of scarlet, crimson,
and the rest, ranged “each under each,” according
to their respective inches, and all together
making up as pretty a show as a crack regiment
at a review. What the passers in and out can
mean by plucking part of a leaf as they go,
rubbing it between their fingers, and then throwing
it away, is more than they (the Geraniums)
can divine.</p>

<p>The other flowers, that present themselves for
the first time in this most fertile of all the months,
must be dismissed with a very brief glance at the
commonest of them: which epithet, by the way,
is always a synonyme for the most beautiful,
among flowers. Now, the favourite family of
the Pinks shoot up their hundred-leaved heads
from out their low ground-loving clump of frosty-looking
leaves, and are in such haste to scatter
abroad their load of sweetness, that they break
down the polished sides of the pretty green vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
in which they are set, and hang about it like
the tresses of a school-girl on the afternoon of
dancing-day.</p>

<p>Now, Sweet-Williams lift up their bold but
handsome faces, right against the meridian Sun,&mdash;disdaining
to shrink or bend beneath his most
ardent gaze: whence, no doubt, their claim to
the name of William; for no lady-flower would
think of doing so!</p>

<p>Now, the Columbine dances a <i>pas-seul</i> to the
music of the breeze; “being her first appearance
this season;” and she performs her part to admiration,
notwithstanding her Harlequin husband,
Fritillary, has not been heard of for this
month past.</p>

<p>Now, the yellow Globe-flower flings up its
balls of gold into the air; and the modest little
Virginia Stock scatters its rubies, and sapphires,
and pearls, profusely upon the ground; and Lupines
spread their wings for flight, but cannot, for
very fondness, escape from the handsome leaves
over which they seem hovering; and Mignonette
begins to make good its pretty name; and,
finally, the princely Poppy, and the starry Marigold,
and the innocent little wild Pansy, and the
pretty Pimpernel, and the dear little blue Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>mander,
<i>will</i> spring up, unasked, all over the
Garden, and you cannot find in your heart to
treat them as weeds.</p>

<p>In the Fruit Garden, all is still for the most
part promise: not, however, the flowery and
often fallacious promise of the Spring; but that
solid and satisfying assurance which one feels in
the word of a friend who never breaks it. So
that, to the eye and palate of the imagination,
this month and the next are richer than those
which follow them; for now you can “<i>have</i>
your fruit and <i>eat</i> it too;” which you cannot do
then. In short, now the fruit blossoms are all
gone, and the fruit is so fully <i>set</i> that nothing
can hurt it; and what is better still, it is not
yet stealable, either by boys, birds, or bees; so
that you are as sure of it as one can be of any
thing the enjoyment of which is not actually
past. Enjoy it now, then, while you may; in
order that, when in the Autumn it <i>disappears</i>,
on the eve of the very day you had destined for
the gathering of it (as every body’s fruit does),
<i>you</i> alone may feel that you can afford to lose
it. Every heir who is worthy to enjoy the estate
that is left to him in reversion, <i>does</i> enjoy it
whether it ever comes to him or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
On looking more closely at the Fruit, we
shall find that the Strawberries, which lately
(like bold and beautiful children) held out their
blossoms into the open sunshine, that all the
world might see them, now, that their fruit is
about to reach maturity, hide it carefully beneath
their low-lying leaves, as conscious virgins
do their maturing beauties;&mdash;that the Gooseberries
and Currants have attained their full
growth, and the latter are turning ripe;&mdash;that
the Wall-fruit is just getting large enough to be
seen among the leaves without looking for;&mdash;that
the Cherries are peeping out in white or
“cherry-cheeked” clusters all along their straight
branches;&mdash;and that the other standards, the
Apples, Pears, and Plums, are more or less
forward, according to their kinds.</p>

<p>For reasons before hinted at, and in deference
to the delicacy of that class of readers for whom
these papers are in part propounded, I must,
however reluctantly, refrain from descending any
lower in the scale of vegetable life. It would ill
become me to speak in praise of Green Peas in
presence of a Peeress&mdash;who could not possibly
understand the allusion! Think of mentioning
Summer Cabbages within hearing of a Countess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
or French Beans to a Baronet’s Lady! I could
not do it. I cannot even persuade myself to
“mention <i>Herbs</i> to ears polite!” If it were not
for this proper, and indeed necessary restriction,
there would be no end to the pleasant sights
I might show the ordinary reader during this
month, in the Kitchen-garden. But it may not
be. I know my duty, and in pursuance of it
must now at once “stay my hand, and change
my measure.”</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Behold us, then, in the heart of London. In
the Country, when we left it, Midsummer was
just at hand. Here mid-Winter has just passed
away! and the Fashionable World finds itself in
a condition of the most melancholy intermediateness.
It is now much too late to stay in Town,
and much too early to go into the Country.
And what is worse, all fashionable amusements
are at an end in London, and have not yet commenced
elsewhere; on the express presumption
that there is no one at hand to partake of them
in either case. There are two places of public
resort, however, which still boast the occasional
countenance of people of fashion; probably on
account of their corresponding with the inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>mediate
character of the month&mdash;not being situated
either in London or the Country, but at
equal distances from each. I mean Kensington
Gardens and Vauxhall. Now, in fact, during
the first fortnight, Kensington Gardens is a place
not to be paralleled: for the unfashionable portion
of my readers are to know, that this delightful
spot, which has been utterly deserted
during the last age (of seven years), and could
not be named during all that period without
incurring the odious imputation of having a
taste for trees and turf, has now suddenly started
into vogue once more, and you may walk there
even during the “morning” part of a Sunday
afternoon with perfect impunity, always provided
you pay a due deference to the decreed
hours, and never make your appearance there
earlier than twenty minutes before five, or later
than half-past six; which is allowing you exactly
two hours after breakfast to dress for the
Promenade, and an hour after you get home to
do the same for dinner: little enough, it must be
confessed; but quite as much as the unremitting
labour of a life of idleness can afford! Between
the abovenamed hours, on the three first Sundays
of this month, and the two last of the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>ceding,
you may (weather willing) gladden your
gaze with such a galaxy of Beauty and Fashion (I
beg to be pardoned for the repetition, for Fashion
<i>is</i> Beauty) as no other period or place, Almack’s
itself not excepted, can boast: for there is no
denying that the fair rulers over this last-named
rendezvous of the regular troops of <i>bon ton</i>
are somewhat too <i>recherchée</i> in their requirements.
The truth is, that though the said
Rulers will not for a moment hesitate to patronise
the above proposition under its simple
form, they entirely object to that subtle interpretation
of it which their sons and nephews
would introduce, and on which interpretation
the sole essential difference between the two assemblies
depends. In fact, at Almack’s Fashion
is Beauty; but at Kensington Gardens Beauty
and Fashion are one. At any rate, those who
have not been present at the latter place during
the period above referred to, have not seen the
finest sight (with one exception) that England
has to offer.</p>

<p>Vauxhall Gardens, which open the first week
in this month, are somewhat different from the
above, it must be confessed. But they are unique
in their way nevertheless. Seen in the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
of noonday, as one passes by them on the top of
the Portsmouth coach, they cut a sorry figure
enough. But beneath the full meridian of midnight,
what is like them, except some parts
of the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments? Now,
after the first few nights, they begin to be in their
glory, and are, on every successive Gala, illuminated
with “ten thousand <i>additional</i> lamps,”
and include all the particular attractions of every
preceding Gala since the beginning of time!</p>

<p>Now, on fine evenings, the sunshine finds (or
rather loses) its way into the galleries of Summer
Theatres at whole price, and wonders where it
has got to. Now, Boarding-school boys, in the
purlieus of Paddington and Mile End, employ
the whole of the first week in writing home to
their distant friends in London a letter of not
less than eight lines, announcing that the “ensuing
vacation will commence on the &mdash;&mdash; instant;”
and occupy the remaining fortnight in
trying to find out the unknown numerals with
which the blank has been filled up.</p>

<p>Finally, now, during the first few days, you
cannot walk the streets without waiting, at every
crossing, for the passage of whole regiments of
little boys in leather breeches, and little girls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
white aprons, going to church to practise their
annual anthem singing, preparatory to that particular
Thursday in this month, which is known
all over the world of Charity Schools by the name
of “walking-day;” when their little voices, ten
thousand strong, are to utter forth sounds that
shall dwell for ever in the hearts of their hearers.
Those who have seen this sight, of all the Charity
Children within the Bills of Mortality assembled
beneath the dome of Saint Paul’s, and heard the
sounds of thanksgiving and adoration which they
utter there, have seen and heard what is perhaps
better calculated than any thing human ever was
to convey to the imagination a faint notion of
what we expect to witness hereafter, when the
Hosts of Heaven shall utter, with <i>one voice</i>,
hymns of adoration before the footstool of the
Most High.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JULY" id="JULY"></a>JULY.</h2>

<p>At last Summer <i>is</i> come among us, and her
whole world of wealth is spread out before us in
prodigal array. The Woods and Groves have
darkened and thickened into one impervious mass
of sober uniform green, and having for a while
ceased to exercise the more active functions of
the Spring, are resting from their labours, in
that state of “wise passiveness” which <i>we</i>, in
virtue of our so infinitely greater wisdom, know
so little how to enjoy. In Winter, the Trees
may be supposed to sleep in a state of insensible
inactivity, and in Spring to be labouring with
the flood of new life that is pressing through their
veins, and forcing them to perform the offices
attached to their existence. But in Summer,
having reached the middle term of their annual
life, they pause in their appointed course, and
then, if ever, <i>taste</i> the nourishment they take in,
and “enjoy the air they breathe.” And he
who, sitting in Summer time beneath the shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
of a spreading Plane-tree, can see its brave
branches fan the soft breeze as it passes, and
hear its polished leaves whisper and twitter to
each other, like birds at love-making; and yet
can feel any thing like an assurance that it does
<i>not</i> enjoy its existence, knows little of the tenure
by which he holds his own, and still less of that
by which he clings to the hope of a future. I
do not ask him to make it an article of his <i>faith</i>
that the flowers feel; but I do ask him, for his
own sake, not to make it an article of his faith
that they <i>do not</i>.</p>

<p>Like the Woods and Groves, the Hills and
Plains have now put off the bright green livery
of Spring; but, unlike them, they have changed
it for one dyed in almost as many colours as a
harlequin’s coat. The Rye is yellow, and almost
ripe for the sickle. The Wheat and Barley are
of a dull green, from their swelling ears being
alone visible, as they bow before every breeze
that blows over them. The Oats are whitening
apace, and quiver, each individual grain on its
light stem, as they hang like rain-drops in the
air. Looked on separately, and at a distance,
these three now wear a somewhat dull and monotonous
hue, when growing in great spaces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
but this makes them contrast the more effectually
with the many-coloured patches that every where
intermix with them, in an extensively open country;
and it is in such a one that we should make
our <i>general</i> observations, at this finest period of
all our year.</p>

<p>What can be more beautiful to look on, from
an eminence, than a great Plain, painted all over
with the party-coloured honours of the early
portion of this month, when the all-pervading
verdure of the Spring has passed away, and
before the scorching heats of Summer have had
time to prevail over the various tints and hues
that have taken its place? The principal share
of the landscape will probably be occupied by
the sober hues of the above-named Corns. But
these will be intersected, in all directions, by
patches of the brilliant emerald which now begins
to spring afresh on the late-mown meadows; by
the golden yellow of the Rye, in some cases cut,
and standing in sheaves; by the rich dark green
of the Turnip-fields; and still more brilliantly,
by sweeps, here and there, of the bright yellow
Charlock, the scarlet Corn-poppy, and the blue
Succory, which, like perverse beauties, scatter
the stray gifts of their charms in proportion as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
the soil cannot afford to support the expenses
attendant on them.</p>

<p>Still keeping in the open Fields, let us come
into a little closer contact with some of the
sights which they present this month. The high
Down on which we took our stand, to look out
upon the above prospect, has begun to feel the
parching influence of the Sun, and is daily growing
browner and browner beneath its rays; but,
to make up for this, all the little Molehills that
cover it are purple with the flowers of the wild
Thyme, which exhales its rich aromatic odour
as you press it with your feet; and among it
the elegant blue Heath-bell is nodding its half-dependent
head from its almost invisible stem,&mdash;its
perpetual motion, at the slightest breath of
air, giving it the look of a living thing hovering
on invisible wings just above the ground. Every
here and there, too, we meet with little patches
of dark green Heaths, hung all over with their
clusters of exquisitely wrought filigree flowers,
endless in the variety of their forms, but all of
the most curiously delicate fabric, and all, in
their minute beauty, unparalleled by the proudest
occupiers of the Parterre. This is the singular
family of Plants that, when cultivated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
pots, and trained to form heads on separate
stems, give one the idea of the Forest Trees of a
Lilliputian people. Those who think there is
nothing in Nature too insignificant for notice,
will not ask us to quit our present spot of observation
(a high turf-covered Down) without
pointing out the innumerable little thread-like
spikes that now rise from out the level turf, with
scarcely perceptible seed-heads at top, and keep
the otherwise dead flat perpetually alive, by
bending and twinkling beneath the Sun and
breeze.</p>

<p>Descending from our high observatory, let us
take our way through one of the pretty green
Lanes that skirt or intersect the Plain we have
been looking down upon. Here we shall find
the ground beneath our feet, the Hedges that
inclose us on either side, and the dry Banks and
damp Ditches beneath them, clothed in a beautiful
variety of flowers that we have not yet had
an opportunity of noticing. In the Hedge-rows
(which are now grown into impervious walls of
many-coloured and many-shaped leaves, from
the fine filigree-work of the White-thorn, to the
large, coarse, round leaves of the Hazel) we shall
find the most remarkable of these, winding up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
intricately among the crowded branches, and
shooting out their flowers here and there, among
other leaves than their own, or hanging themselves
into festoons and fringes on the outside,
by unseen tendrils. Most conspicuous among
the first of these is the great Bind-weed, thrusting
out its elegantly-formed snow-white flowers,
but carefully concealing its leaves and stem in
the thick of the shrubs which yield it support.
Nearer to the ground, and more exposed, we
shall meet with a handsome relative of the
above, the common red and white wild Convolvolus;
while all along the face of the Hedge,
clinging to it lightly, the various coloured
Vetches, and the Enchanter’s Night-shade, hang
their flowers into the open air; the first exquisitely
fashioned, with wings like the Pea,
only smaller; and the other elaborate in its construction,
and even beautiful, with its rich purple
petals turned back to expose a centre of deep
yellow; but still, with all its beauty, not without
a strange and sinister look, which at once points
it out as a poison-flower. It is this which afterwards
turns to those bunches of scarlet berries
which hang so temptingly in Autumn, just
within the reach of little children, and which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
requires all the eloquence of their grandmothers
to prevent them from tasting. In the midst of
these, and above them all, the Woodbine now
hangs out its flowers more profusely than ever,
and rivals in sweetness all the other field scents
of this month.</p>

<p>On the bank from which the Hedge-row rises,
and on <i>this</i> side of the now nearly dry water-channel
beneath, fringing the border of the green
path on which we are walking, a most rich
variety of Field Flowers will also now be found.
We dare not stay to notice the half of them,
because their beauties, though even more exquisite
than those hitherto described, are of that
unobtrusive nature that you must stoop to pick
them up, and must come to an actual commune
with them, before they can be even seen distinctly;
which is more than our desultory and
fugitive gaze will permit,&mdash;the plan of our walk
only allowing us to pay the passing homage of a
word to those objects that <i>will</i> not be overlooked.
Many of the exquisite little Flowers, now alluded
to generally, look, as they lie among their low
leaves, only like minute morsels of many-coloured
glass scattered upon the green ground&mdash;scarlet,
and sapphire, and rose, and purple, and white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
and azure, and golden. But pick them up, and
bring them towards the eye, and you will find
them pencilled with a thousand dainty devices,
and elaborated into the most exquisite forms
and fancies, fit to be strung into necklaces for
fairy Titania, or set in broaches and bracelets for
the neatest-handed of her nymphs.</p>

<p>The little flowers of which I now speak,&mdash;with
their minute blossoms, scarcely bigger than pins’
heads, scattered singly among their low-lying
leaves,&mdash;are the Veronicas, particularly that called
the Wild Germander, with its flowers coloured
like no others, nor like any thing else, except the
Turquoise; the Scarlet Pimpernel; the Red Eyebright;
and the Bastard Pimpernel, the smallest
of flowers. All these, however, and their like,
I must pass over (as the rest of the world does)
without noticing them particularly; but not
without commending them to the reader’s best
leisure, and begging him to give to each one of
them more of it than I have any hope he will
bestow on me, or than he would bestow half so
well if he did.</p>

<p>But there are many others that come into
bloom this month, some of which we cannot pass
unnoticed if we would. We shall meet with most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
of them in this green Lane, and beside the paths
through the meadows and corn-fields as we proceed
homeward. Conspicuous among them are
the Centaury, with its elegant cluster of small,
pink, star-like flowers; the Ladies’ Bed-straw,
with its rich yellow tufts; the Meadow-sweet&mdash;sweetest
of all the sweeteners of the Meadows;
the Wood Betony, lifting up its handsome head
of rose-coloured blossoms; and, still in full perfection,
and towering up from among the low
groundlings that usually surround it, the stately
Fox-glove.</p>

<p>Among the other plants that now become conspicuous,
the Wild Teasal must not be forgotten,
if it be only on account of the use that one of the
Summer’s prettiest denizens sometimes makes of
it. The Wild Teasal (which now puts on as
much the appearance of a flower as its rugged
nature will let it) is that species of thistle which
shoots up a strong serrated stem, straight as an
arrow, and beset on all sides by hard sharp-pointed
thorns, and bearing on its summit a hollow
egg-shaped head, also covered at all points
with the same armour of threatening thorns&mdash;as
hard, as thickly set, and as sharp as a porcupine’s
quills. Often within this fortress, im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>pregnable
to birds, bees, and even to mischievous
boys themselves, that beautiful Moth which
flutters about so gaily during the first weeks of
Summer, on snow-white wings spotted all over
with black and yellow, takes up its final abode,&mdash;retiring
thither when weary of its desultory
wanderings, and after having prepared for the
perpetuation of its ephemeral race, sleeping itself
to death, to the rocking lullaby of the breeze.</p>

<p>Now, too, if we pass near some gently lapsing
water, we may chance to meet with the splendid
flowers of the Great Water Lily, floating on the
surface of the stream like some fairy vessel at anchor,
and making visible, as it ripples by it, the
elsewhere imperceptible current. Nothing can
be more elegant than each of the three different
states under which this flower now appears;&mdash;the
first, while it lies unopened among its undulating
leaves, like the Halcyon’s egg within
its floating nest; next, when its snowy petals are
but half expanded, and you are almost tempted
to wonder what beautiful bird it is that has just
taken its flight from such a sweet birth-place;
and lastly, when the whole flower floats confessed,
and spreading wide upon the water its
pointed petals, offers its whole heart to the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>amoured
sun. There is I know not what of <i>awful</i>,
in the beauty of this flower. It is, to all other
flowers, what Mrs. Siddons is to all other women.</p>

<p>In the same water, congregating together towards
the edge, and bowing their black heads
to the breeze, we shall now see those strange
anomalies in vegetation, the flowers, or fruit, or
whatever else they are to be called, of the Bullrush,
the delight of village boys, when, like their
betters, they are disposed to “play at soldiers.”
And on the bank, the handsome Iris hangs out
its pale flag, as if to beg a truce of the besieging
sun.</p>

<p>Before entering the Garden, to luxuriate
among the flocks of Flowers that are waiting
for us there, let us notice a few of the miscellaneous
objects that present themselves this month
in the open country. Now, then, cattle wade
into shallow pools of warm water, and stand half
the day there stock still, in exact imitation of
Cuyp’s pictures.&mdash;Now, breechesless little boys
become amphibious,&mdash;daring each other to dive
off banks a foot high, to the bottom of water
two feet deep.&mdash;Now, country gentlemen who
wander through new-cut Rye-fields, or across
sunny meadows, are first startled from their re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>veries
by the rushing sound of many wings, and
straightway lay gunpowder plots against the
peace of partridges, and have visions redolent
of double-barrelled guns.&mdash;Now, another class of
children, of a smaller growth than the above, go
through one of their preparatory lessons in the
pleasant and profitable art of lying, by persuading
Lady-birds to “fly away home” from
the tops of their extended fingers, on the forged
information that “their house is on fire, their
children at home.”</p>

<p>Now, those most active and industrious of the
feathered tribes, the Swallows and House Martins,
bring out their young broods into the cherishing
sunshine, and having taught them to provide for
themselves, they send them “about their business,”
of congregating on slate-roofed houses and
churches, and round the tops of belfry towers;
while they (the parents) proceed in their periodical
duty of providing new flocks of the same
kind of “fugitive pieces,” as regularly as the
editors of a Magazine.</p>

<p>Now may be observed that singular phenomenon
which (like all other phenomena) puzzles all
those observers who never take the trouble of observing.
Whole meadows, lanes, and commons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
are covered, for days together, with myriads of
young Frogs, no bigger than horse-beans,&mdash;though
there is no water in the immediate neighbourhood,
where they are likely to have been
bred, and the ponds and places where they <i>are</i>
likely to breed are entirely empty of them.
“Where <i>can</i> they have come from in this case,
but from the clouds?” say the before-named
observers. Accordingly, from the clouds they
<i>do</i> come, the opinion of all such searching inquirers;
and I am by no means sure they will
be at all obliged to me for telling them, that the
water in which these animals are born is not
their natural element, and that, on quitting their
Tad-pole state, they choose the first warm shower
to <i>migrate</i> from their birth-place, in search of
that food and home which cannot be found <i>there</i>.
The circumstance of their almost always appearing
for the first time after a warm shower, no
doubt encourages the searchers after mystery in
assigning them a miraculous origin.</p>

<p>Now, the Bees (those patterns of all that is
praiseworthy in domestic and political economy)
give practical lessons on the Principles of Population,
by expelling from the hive, <i>vi et armis</i>,
all those heretofore members of it who refuse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
aid the commonweal by working for their daily
honey. When they need those services which
none but the Drones can perform, they let them
live in idleness and feed luxuriously. But as the
good deeds of the latter are of that class which
“in doing pay themselves,” those who benefit by
them think that they owe the doers no thanks,
and therefore, when they no longer need them,
send them adrift, or if they will not go, sacrifice
them without mercy or remorse. And this&mdash;be
it known to all whom it may concern (and those
are not a few)&mdash;this is the very essence of Natural
Justice.</p>

<p>Now, as they are wandering across the meadows
thinking of nothing less, gleams of white
among the green grass greet the eyes of bird-nesting
boys, who all at once dart upon the
welcome prize, and draw out from its hiding-place
piece-meal what was once a Mushroom;
and forthwith mushrooming becomes the order
of the day.&mdash;Now, the lowermost branches of
the Lime-tree are “musical with Bees,” who
eagerly beset its almost unseen blossoms&mdash;richer
in sweets than the sweetest inhabitants of the
garden.</p>

<p>Finally, now we occasionally have one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
sultry days which make the house too hot to
hold us, and force us to seek shelter in the open
air, which is hotter;&mdash;when the interior of the
Blacksmith’s shop looks awful, and we expect
the foaming porter pot to hiss, as the brawny
forger dips his fiery nose into it;&mdash;when the
Birds sit open-mouthed upon the bushes; and
the Fishes fry in the shallow ponds; and the
Sheep and Cattle congregate together in the
shade, and forget to eat;&mdash;when pedestrians
along dusty roads quarrel with their coats and
waistcoats, and cut sticks to carry them across
their shoulders; and cottagers’ wives go about
their work gown-less; and their daughters are
anxious to do the same, but that they have the
fear of the Vicar before their eyes;&mdash;when every
thing seen beyond a piece of parched soil quivers
through the heated air; and when, finally, a
snow-white Swan, floating above its own image,
upon a piece of clear cool water into which a
Weeping-Willow is dipping its green fingers, is
a sight not to be turned from suddenly.</p>

<p>But we must no longer delay to glance at the
Garden, which is now fuller of beauty than ever:
for nearly all the flowers of last month still
continue in perfection, and for one that has dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>appeared,
half a dozen have started forward to
supply its place.</p>

<p>Against the house, or overhanging the shaded
arbour, among Shrubs, we have the Jasmin,
shooting out its stars of white light from among
its throng of slender leaves; and the white
Clematis (well worthy of both its other names,
of Virgin’s Bower, and Traveller’s Joy) flinging
its wreaths of scented snow athwart the portico,
and rivaling the Hawthorn in sweetness; and
the Syringa, sweeter still. Now, too, the large
Lilies lift up their lofty heads proudly, and do
not seem to forget that they once held the rank
of Queens of the Garden;&mdash;the rich-scented white
one looking, in comparison with the red, what a
handsome Countess does to a handsome Cook-maid.</p>

<p>Among the less aspiring we have now several
whose beauty almost makes us forget their want
of sweetness. Conspicuous among these are the
Convolvulus, whose elegant trumpet-shaped cups
open their blue eyes to greet the sun, and, at
his going down, close them never to open again;
and the Nasturtium, as gaudy in its scarlet
and gold as an Officer of the Guards on a levee
day; and the fine-cut Indian Pink; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
profuse Larkspur, all flower, shooting up its
many-coloured cones here and there at random,
or ranging them in rich companies, that rival the
Tulip-beds of the Spring.</p>

<p>In the Orchard and Fruit-Garden the hopes
of the last month begin in part to be realized,
and in all to be confirmed. The elegant Currant,
red and white (the Grape of our northern
latitudes), now hangs its transparent bunches
close about the parent stem, and looks through
its green embowering leaves most invitingly.
But there you had best let it hang as yet, till
the Autumn has sweetened its wine with sunbeams:
for Autumn is your only honest wine-maker
in this country; all others sweeten with
sugar-of-lead instead of sunshine.&mdash;The Gooseberry,
too, has gained its full growth, but had
better be left where it is for awhile, to mature
its pleasant condiment. As for the Tarts into
which it is the custom to translate it during this
and the last month,&mdash;they are “pleasant but
wrong.”&mdash;Now, too, is in full perfection the most
grateful fruit that grows, and the most wholesome&mdash;the
Strawberry. I grieve to be obliged
to make “odious comparisons” of this kind, between
things that are all alike healthful, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
the partakers of them are living under natural
and healthful circumstances. But if Man <i>will</i>
live upon what was not intended for him, he
must be content to see what <i>was</i> intended for him
lose its intended effect. The Strawberry is the
only fruit in which we may indulge to excess with
impunity: accordingly I hereby give all my
readers (the young ones in particular) Mr. Abernethy’s
full permission to commit a debauch of
Strawberries once every week during this month,
always provided they can do it at the bed itself;
for otherwise they are taking an unfair advantage
of nature, and must expect that she will make
reprisals on them.&mdash;Now, too, the Raspberry is
delicious, if gathered and eaten at its place of
growth. There it is fragrant and full of flavour,
elsewhere flat and insipid.</p>

<p>The other fruits of this month are Apricot,
one or two of the early Apples, and if the season
is forward a few Cherries. But of these, the two
latter belong by rights to the next month; so till
then we leave them. And as for Apricots, they
look handsome enough at a distance, against the
wall; but they offer so barefaced an imitation of
the outward appearance of Peaches and Nectarines,
without possessing any one of their intrinsic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
merits, that I have a particular contempt for
them, and beg the reader to dismiss them from
his good graces accordingly.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Of London in July&mdash;“<i>London</i> in <i>July</i>?”&mdash;surely
there can be no such place! It sounds
like a kind of contradiction in terms. But, alas!
there <i>is</i> such a place, as yonder thick cloud of
dust, and the blare of the horn that issues from
it, too surely indicate. And what is worse, we
must, in pursuance of our self-imposed duty,
proceed thither without delay. We cannot,
therefore, do better (or worse) than mount the
coming vehicle (the motto of which at this time
of the year ought to be “per me si va nella
citta, dolente,”) and,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Half in a cloud of stifling road-dust lost,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>get there as soon as we can, that we may the
sooner get away again.</p>

<p>Of London in July, there is happily little
to be said; but let that little be said good
humouredly; for London <i>is</i> London, after all&mdash;ay,
even after having ridden fifty miles on the
burning roof of the Gloucester Heavy, to get at
it. Now, then, London is entirely empty; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
much so that a person well practised in the art of
walking its streets might wager that he would
make his way from St. Paul’s to Charing Cross
(a distance of more than a mile) within forty
minutes!</p>

<p>Now, the <i>Winter</i> Theatres having just closed,
the Summer ones “make hay <i>while the sun
shines</i>.” At that in the Hay-market Mr. Liston
acts the part of Atlas,&mdash;supporting every thing
(the heat included) with inimitable coolness;
while, in virtue of his attractions, the Managers
can afford annually to put in execution their
benevolent and patriotic plan, of permitting the
principal <i>Barn-staple</i> actors to practise upon the
patience of a London Pit with impunity.</p>

<p>At the English Opera-house the Managers,
(Mr. Peake),&mdash;for fear the public, amid the refreshing
coolness of the Upper Boxes, should
forget that it is Summer time,&mdash;transfer the
country into the confines of their Saloon (having
purchased it at and for half-price in Covent
Garden Market); and there, from six till eight,
flowers of all hues look at each other by lamp-light
despondingly, and after that hour turn
their attention to the new accession of flowers,
the Painted Ladies, which do not till then begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
blowing in this singular soil. In the mean time,
on the stage, Mr. Wrench (that easiest of actors
with the hardest of names) carries all before him,
not excepting his arms and hands. I never see
Wrench, [who, by the bye, or by any other means
that he can, ought by all means to get rid of the
roughening letter in his name, and call himself
Wench, Tench, Clench, Bench, or any other
that may please him and us better. Indeed I
cannot in conscience urge him to adopt either of
the above, if he can possibly find another guiltless
of that greatest of all enormities in a name,
the susceptibility of being punned upon; for it
is obvious that if he <i>should</i> adopt either of the
above, he must not, on his first after appearance
in the Green Room, hope to escape from his
punegyrical friend Mr. Peake, without being told,
in the first case, (Wench) that his place is not
<i>there</i> but in the <i>other</i> Green Room (the Saloon);&mdash;in
the second, (Tench) that he need not
have changed his name, for that he was a sufficiently
<i>odd fish</i> before;&mdash;in the third, (Clench)
that he (Mr. P.) is greatly in want of a clever
one for the finale of his next farce, and begs to
make use of <i>him</i> on the occasion;&mdash;and in the
fourth, (Bench) that, belonging to a Royal Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>pany,
he is neither more nor less than the <i>King’s
Bench</i>, and “as such” must not be surprised if
his theatrical friends fly to <i>him</i> for shelter and
protection in their hour of need, in preference to
his name-sake over the water.&mdash;I beg the reader
to remember, that the punishment due to all
these prospective puns belongs exclusively to
Mr. Peake; and on him let them be visited accordingly.
Though I doubt not he will intimate
in extenuation, that they are quite <i>pun-ish-meant</i>
enough in themselves.&mdash;But where was I?&mdash;oh]&mdash;I
never see Wrench without fearing that, some
day or other, a gleam of common sense may by
accident miss its way to the brain of our winter
managers, and they may bethink them (for if
one does, both will) of offering an engagement
to this most engaging of actors. But if they
should, let me beseech him to turn (if he has
one) a deaf ear to their entreaties; for we had
need have something to look for at a Summer
Theatre that cannot be had elsewhere.</p>

<p>I am not qualified to descend any lower than
the Major of the Minor Theatres, in regard to
what is doing there at this season; though it
appears that Mr. Ducrow is still satisfying those
who were not satisfied of it before, that Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>manship
is one of the Fine Arts; and though
the Bills of the Coburg append sixteen instead
of six notes of admiration to Mr. Nobody’s name.
Being somewhat fastidious in the affair of phraseology,
the only mode in which I can explain my
remissness in regard to the above particular is,
that, whereas at this season of the year <i>Steam
conveys us</i> to all other places,&mdash;from the theatres
frequented by throngs of “rude mechanicals” it
most effectually keeps us away.</p>

<p>Now, on warm evenings after business hours,
citizens of all ages grow romantic; the single,
wearing away their souls in sighing to the breezes
of Brixton Hill, and their soles in getting there;
and the married, sipping syllabub in the arbours
of White Conduit House, or cooling themselves
with hot rolls and butter at the New River
Head.</p>

<p>Now, too, moved by the same spirit of Romance,
young patricians, who have not yet been
persuaded to banish themselves to the beauty
of their paternal groves, fling themselves into
funnies, and fatigue their <i>ennui</i> to death, by
rowing up the river to Mrs. Grange’s garden,
to eat a handful of strawberries in a cup-full of
cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
Now, adventurous cockneys swim from the
Sestos of the Strand stairs to the Abydos of the
coal-barge on the opposite shore, and believe
that they have been rivaling Lord Byron and
Leander&mdash;not without wondering, when they find
themselves in safety, why the Lady for whom the
latter performed a similar feat is called the Hero
of the story, instead of the Heroine.</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;now pains-and-pleasure taking citizens
hire cozey cottages for six weeks certain in
the Curtain Road, and ask their friends to come
and see them “in the country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="AUGUST" id="AUGUST"></a>AUGUST.</h2>

<p>The Year has now reached the parallel to
that brief, but perhaps best period of human life,
when the promises of youth are either fulfilled or
forgotten, and the fears and forethoughts connected
with decline have not yet grown strong
enough to make themselves felt; and consequently
when we have nothing to do but look
around us, and be happy. It has, indeed, like a
man at forty, turned the corner of its existence;
but, like him, it may still fancy itself young,
because it does not begin to feel itself getting
old. And perhaps there is no period like this,
for encouraging and bringing to perfection that
habit of tranquil enjoyment, in which all true
happiness must mainly consist: with <i>pleasure</i> it
has, indeed, little to do; but with <i>happiness</i> it
is every thing.</p>

<p>August is that debateable ground of the year,
which is situated exactly upon the confines of
Summer and Autumn; and it is difficult to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
which has the better claim to it. It is dressed
in half the flowers of the one, and half the fruits
of the other; and it has a sky and a temperature
all its own, and which vie in beauty with those
of the Spring. May itself can offer nothing so
sweet to the senses, so enchanting to the imagination,
and so soothing to the heart, as that genial
influence which arises from the sights, the sounds,
and the associations connected with an August
evening in the Country, when the occupations
and pleasures of the day are done, and when all,
even the busiest, are fain to give way to that
“wise passiveness,” one hour of which is rife
with more real enjoyment than a whole season
of revelry. Those who will be wise (or foolish)
enough to make comparisons between the various
kinds of pleasure of which the mind of man is
capable, will find that there is none (or but one)
equal to that felt by a true lover of Nature, when
he looks forth upon her open face silently, at a
season like the present, and drinks in that still
beauty which seems to emanate from every thing
he sees, till his whole senses are steeped in a
sweet forgetfulness, and he becomes unconscious
of all but that <i>instinct of good</i> which is ever
present with us, but which can so seldom make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
itself felt amid that throng of thoughts which
are ever busying and besieging us, in our intercourse
with the living world. The only other
feeling which equals this, in its intense quietude,
and its satisfying fulness, is one which is almost
identical with it,&mdash;where the accepted lover is
gazing unobserved, and almost unconsciously, on
the face of his mistress, and tracing there sweet
evidences of that mysterious union which already
exists between them. The great charm of
Claude’s pictures consists in their power of generating,
to a certain degree, the description of
feeling above alluded to; a feeling which no
other pictures produce in the slightest degree;
and which even his produce only enough of to
either remind us of what we have experienced
before, or give us a foretaste of what Nature
herself has in store for us. And I only mention
them here, in order that those who are accustomed
to expend themselves in admiration of the
copies may be led to look at the originals in the
same spirit; when they will find, that the one is
to the other, what a thought is to a feeling, or
what a beautiful mask is to the beautiful living
face from which it was modelled. Let the professed
enthusiasts to Claude look at Nature’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
pictures through the same eyes, and with the
same prepared feelings, as they look at his (which
few, if any of them have ever done), and they
will find that they have hitherto been content to
<i>fancy</i> what they now <i>feel</i>; and this discovery will
not derogate from the value of the said fancy,
but will, on the contrary, make it more effective
by making it less vague. When you hear people
extravagant in their general praise of Claude’s
Landscapes, you may shrewdly suspect that they
have never experienced in the presence of Nature
herself those sensations which enabled Claude to
be what he was; and that, in admiring him, they
have only been yielding to involuntary yearnings
after that Nature which they have hitherto
neglected to look upon. They have been worshipping
the image, and passing by the visible
god.</p>

<p>The whole face of Nature has undergone,
since last month, an obvious change; obvious to
those who delight to observe all her changes and
operations, but not sufficiently striking to insist
on being seen generally by those who can read
no characters but such as are written in a <i>text</i>
hand. If the general <i>colours</i> of all the various
departments of natural scenery are not changed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
their <i>hues</i> are; and if there is not yet observable
the infinite variety of Autumn, there is as little
the extreme monotony of Summer. In one department,
however, there <i>is</i> a general change,
that cannot well remain unobserved. The rich
and unvarying green of the Corn-fields has entirely
and almost suddenly changed, to a still
richer and more conspicuous gold colour; more
conspicuous on account of the contrast it now
offers to the lines, patches, and masses of green
with which it every where lies in contact, in
the form of intersecting Hedge-rows, intervening
Meadows, and bounding masses of Forest. These
latter are changed too; but in <i>hue</i> alone, not in
colour. They are all of them still green; but it
is not the fresh and tender green of the Spring,
nor the full and satisfying, though somewhat
dull, green of the Summer; but many greens,
that blend all those belonging to the seasons
just named, with others at once more grave and
more bright; and the charming variety and interchange
of which are peculiar to this delightful
month, and are more beautiful in their general
effect than those of either of the preceding periods:
just as a truly beautiful woman is perhaps
more beautiful at the period immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
before that at which her charms begin to wane,
than she ever was before. Here, however, the
comparison must end; for with the year its incipient
decay is the signal for it to put on more
and more beauties daily, till, when it reaches the
period at which it is on the point of sinking
into the temporary death of Winter, it is more
beautiful in general appearance than ever.</p>

<p>But we must not anticipate. We may linger
upon one spot, or step aside from our path, or
return upon our steps; but we must not anticipate;
for those who would duly enjoy and
appreciate the Present and the Past, must wait
for the Future till it comes to them. The Future
and the Present are jealous of each other; and
those who attempt to enjoy both at the same
time, will not be graciously received by either.</p>

<p>The general appearance of natural scenery is
now much more varied in its character than it
has hitherto been. The Corn-fields are all redundant
with waving gold&mdash;gold of all hues&mdash;from
the light yellow of the Oats (those which
still remain uncut), to the deep sunburnt glow of
the red Wheat. But the wide rich sweeps of
these fields are now broken in upon, here and
there, by patches of the parched and withered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
looking Bean crops; by occasional bits of newly
ploughed land, where the Rye lately stood; by
the now darkening Turnips&mdash;dark, except where
they are being fed off by Sheep Flocks; and
lastly by the still bright-green Meadows, now
studded every where with grazing cattle, the
second crops of Grass being already gathered
in.</p>

<p>The Woods, as well as the single Timber
Trees that occasionally start up with such fine
effect from out the Hedge-rows, or in the midst
of Meadows and Corn-fields, we shall now find
sprinkled with what at first looks like gleams of
scattered sunshine lying among the leaves, but
what, on examination, we shall find to be the
new foliage that has been put forth since Midsummer,
and which yet retains all the brilliant
green of the Spring. The effect of this new
green, lying in sweeps and patches upon the old,
though little observed in general, is one of the
most beautiful and characteristic appearances of
this season. In many cases, when the sight of
it is caught near at hand, on the sides of thick
Plantations, the effect of it is perfectly deceptive,
and you wonder for a moment how it is, that
while the sun is shining so brightly <i>every where</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
it should shine so much <i>more</i> brightly on those
particular spots.</p>

<p>We shall find those pretty wayside Shrubberies,
the Hedge-rows, and the Field-flower-borders
that lie beneath and about them, less
gay with new green, and less fantastic with
flowers, than they have lately been; but they
still vie with the Garden both in sweetness and
in beauty. The new flowers they put forth this
month are but few. Among these are the pretty
little Meadow Scabious, with its small purple head
standing away from its leaves; the various Goosefoots,
curious for their leaves, feeling about like
fingers for the fresh air; the Camomile, shooting
up its troops of little suns, with their yellow
centres and white rays; and a few more of lesser
note. But, in addition to these, we have still
many which have already had their greeting
from us, <i>or should have had</i>; but really, when
one comes every month, self-invited, to Nature’s
morning levees, and meets there flocks of flowers,
every one of which claims as its single due a
whole morning’s attention, it must not be taken
as unkind or impolite by any of them, if, in
endeavouring hastily to record the company we
met, for the benefit of those who were not there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
we should chance to forget some who may fancy
themselves quite as worthy of having their presence
recorded, and their court dresses described,
as those who do figure in this Court Calendar of
Nature. It is possible, too, that we may have
fallen into some slight errors in regard to the
places of residence of some of our fair flowery
friends, and the particular day on which they
first chose to make their appearance at Nature’s
court; for we are not among those reporters who
take short-hand notes, or any other, but such as
write themselves in the tablet of our memory.
But if any lady <i>should</i> feel herself aggrieved in
either of the above particulars, she has only to
drop us a leaf to that effect, stating, at the same
time, her name and residence, and she may be
assured that we shall take the first opportunity
of paying our personal respects to her, and shall
have little doubt of satisfying her that our misconduct
has arisen from any thing rather than a
wilful neglect towards her pretensions, or a want
of taste in appreciating them. In the mean time
let us add, that, in addition to the new company
which graces this month’s levee, the following
are still punctual in their attendance; namely,
Woodbine, Woodruff, Meadow-sweet, and Wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
Thyme; (N. B. These ladies are still profuse in
their use of perfumes); and, among those who
depend on their beauty alone, Eyebright, Pansie,
the lesser and greater Willow-herb, Daisy, two
or three of the Orchises, Hyacinth, several sisters
of the Speedwell and Pimpernel families, and the
scentless Violet.</p>

<p>Now, after the middle of the month, commences
that great rural employment to which all
the hopes of the farmer’s year have been tending;
but which, unhappily, the mere labourer
has come to regard with as much indifference
as he does any of those which have successively
led to it. This latter is not as it should be.
But as we cannot hope to alter, let us not stay
to lament over it. On the contrary, let us rejoice
that at least Nature remains uninjured&mdash;that
<i>she</i> shows more beautiful than ever at harvest
time, whether Man chooses to be more happy then
or not. It is true Harvest-home has changed its
moral character, in the exact proportion that the
people among whom it takes place have changed
<i>theirs</i>, in becoming, from an agricultural, a mechanical
and manufacturing nation; and we may
soon expect to see the produce of the earth
gathered in and laid by for use, almost without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
the intervention of those for whose use it is provided,
and in supplying whose wants it is chiefly
consumed: for the rich, so far from being “able
to live by bread alone,” would scarcely feel the
loss if it were wholly to fail them. But Nature
is not to be changed by the devices which man
employs to change and deteriorate himself. She
has willed that the scenes attendant on the gathering
in of her gifts shall be as fraught with
beauty as ever. And accordingly, Harvest time
is as delightful to look on to <i>us</i>, who are mere
spectators of it, as it was in the Golden Age,
when the gatherers and the rejoicers were one.
Now, therefore, as then, the Fields are all alive
with figures and groups, that seem, in the eye of
the artist, to be made for pictures&mdash;pictures that
he can see but one fault in; (which fault, by the
bye, constitutes their only beauty in the eye of
the farmer;) namely, that they will not stand
still a moment, for him to paint them. He must
therefore be content, as we are, to keep them as
studies in the storehouse of his memory.</p>

<p>Here are a few of those studies, which he may
practise upon till doomsday, and will not then be
able to produce half the effect from them that
will arise spontaneously on the imagination, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
the mere mention of the simplest words which can
describe them:&mdash;The sunburnt Reapers, entering
the Field leisurely at early morning, with their
reaphooks resting on their right shoulders, and
their beer-kegs swinging to their left hands, while
they pause for a while to look about them before
they begin their work.&mdash;The same, when they are
scattered over the Field: some stooping to the
ground over the prostrate Corn, others lifting up
the heavy sheaves and supporting them against
one another, while the rest are plying their busy
sickles, before which the brave crop seems to
retreat reluctantly, like a half-defeated army.&mdash;Again,
the same collected together into one group,
and resting to refresh themselves, while the lightening
keg passes from one to another silently, and
the rude clasp-knife lifts the coarse meal to the
ruddy lips.&mdash;Lastly, the piled-up Wain, moving
along heavily among the lessening sheaves, and
swaying from side to side as it moves; while a
few, whose share of the work is already done, lie
about here and there in the shade, and watch the
near completion of it.</p>

<p>I would fain have to describe the boisterous
and happy revelries that used to ensue upon
these scenes, and should do still. And what if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
they were attended by mirth a little over-riotous,
or a few broken crowns? Better so, than the
troops of broken spirits that now linger amidst
the overflowing plenty of the last Harvest-field,
and begin to think where they shall wander in
search of their next week’s bread.</p>

<p>But no more of this. Let us turn at once to
a few of the other occurrences that take place
in the open Fields during this month. The
Singing Birds are, for the most part, so busy in
educating and providing for their young broods,
that they have little time to practise their professional
duties; consequently this month is
comparatively a silent one in the Woods and
Groves. There are some, however, whose happy
hearts will not let them be still. The most persevering
of these is that poet of the skies, the Lark.
He still pours down a bright rain of melody
through the morning, the mid-day, and the
evening skies, till the whole air seems sparkling
and alive with the light of his strains.&mdash;His
sweet-hearted relation, the Woodlark, also still
warbles high up in the warm evening air, and
occasionally even at midnight&mdash;hovering at one
particular spot during each successive strain.&mdash;The
Goldfinch, the Yellowhammer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
Green and Brown Linnet, those pretty flutterers
among the summer leaves,&mdash;as light hearted and
restless as they,&mdash;still keep whistling snatches of
their old songs, between their quick fairy-like
flittings from bough to bough. As for the solitary
Robin, his delicate song may be heard all
through the year, and is peculiarly acceptable
now in the neighbourhood of human dwellings&mdash;where
no other is heard, unless it be the common
wren’s.</p>

<p>By the middle of this month we shall lose
sight entirely of that most airy, active, and indefatigable
of all the winged people,&mdash;the Swift&mdash;Shakespeare’s
“temple-haunting Martlet.” Unlike
the rest of its tribe, it breeds but once in the
season; and its young having now acquired much
of their astonishing power of wing, young and
old all hurry away together&mdash;no one can tell
whither. The sudden departure of the above
singular species of the Swallow tribe, at this very
moment, when every thing seems to conform together
for their delight,&mdash;when the winds (which
they shun) are hushed&mdash;and the Summer (in
which they rejoice) is at its best&mdash;and the air
(in which they feed) is laden with dainties for
them&mdash;and all the troubles and anxieties attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>ant
on the coming of their young broods are at
an end, and they are wise enough not to think of
having more;&mdash;that, at the very moment when
all these favourable circumstances are combining
together to make them happy, they should suddenly,
and without any assignable cause whatever,
disappear, and go no one knows whither,
is one of those facts, the explanation of which has
hitherto baffled all our inquiring philosophizers,
and will continue to do so while the said inquirers
continue to judge of all things by analogies
invented by their own boasted <i>reason</i>: as if
reason were given us to explain instinct! and as
if a being which passes its whole life on the wing&mdash;(for
sleep is not a part of life, and the Swift,
during its waking hours, never sets foot on tree
or ground&mdash;almost realizing that fabled bird
which has wings but no feet) were not likely to be
gifted with any senses but such as <i>we</i> can trace
the operations of! The truth is, all that we can
make of this mysterious departure is, to accept
it as an omen&mdash;the earliest, the most certain, and
yet the least attended to, because it happens
in the midst of smiling contradictions to it&mdash;that
the departure of Summer herself is nigh at
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
It is not good to cull out the sad points of reflection
which present themselves, in the various
subjects which come before us, in contemplating
the operations of Nature. But as little is it good,
studiously to avoid those points. Perhaps the
only wise course is, to let them suggest what
they will, of sadness or of joy; and then, so to
receive and apply those suggestions, that even the
sad ones themselves may be made subservient to
good. To me, this early departure, in the very
heart of our summer, of the most bird-like of all
the birds that visit us only for a season, always
comes at first like an omen of evil, that I cannot
doubt, and yet will not believe. It might as well
be told me, that the being who sits beside me
now, in all the pomp of health, and all the lustre
of loveliness, will leave me to-morrow, and go&mdash;like
the bird&mdash;I know not whither. And yet, if
such a prediction <i>were</i> made to me, what should
I do in regard to it, but (as one ought in the case
of the omen of departing summer) to <i>believe</i> that
it is true, and yet <i>feel</i> that it is false; and, acting
upon the joint impulse thus created, enjoy the
blessing tenfold, while it remains mine, and leave
the lamentations for its loss till I can no longer
feel the delight that flows from its presence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
But, enough of philosophy&mdash;even of that
which is intended to cure us of philosophizing.
Let us get into the air and the sunshine again;
which can bid us be happy in spite of all
philosophy, and <i>will</i> be obeyed even by philosophers
themselves,&mdash;who have long since found
that they have no resource left against those
enemies to their art, but to fly their presence, and
shut themselves up in schools and studies.</p>

<p>The Swift, whose strange flight has for a
moment led us astray from our course, is the
only one of its tribe that has yet made any preparations
towards departure: though the young
broods of House-swallows and House-martins are
evidently <i>thinking</i> of it, and congregating together
in great flocks, about the tops of old
towers and belfries, to talk the matter over, and
wonder with one another what will happen to
them in their projected travels&mdash;if they <i>do</i> travel.
Their parents, however, who are to lead them,
are still employed in increasing their company,
and have just now brought out their second
broods into the open air.</p>

<p>Now, on warm still evenings, we may sometimes
see the whole air about us speckled with
another class of emigrants, who are not usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
regarded as such; namely, the flying Ants, whom
their own offspring, or their inclinations (for it is
uncertain which), have expelled from their birth-place,
to found new colonies, and find new habitations,
where they can. It is a ticklish task to
make people more knowing than they wish to be,
and one which, even if I were qualified for the
office, I should be very shy of undertaking.
But when a race of comparatively foolish and
improvident little creatures have for ages enjoyed
the credit of being proverbial patterns of wisdom,
prudence, and forethought, I cannot refuse
to assist in dispelling the delusion. Be it
known, then, to the elderly namesakes of the
above, that when they bid their little nephews
and nieces “go to the Ant, and consider its
ways,” they can scarcely offer them advice less
likely to end, if followed, in teaching them to
“be wise:” for, in fact, one of those “ways” is, to
sleep (“sluggards” as they are!) all the winter
through; another is, never to lay up a single
morsel of store even for a day, much less for a
whole year, as has been reported of them; and a
third is, to do what they are in fact doing at
this very moment&mdash;namely, to come out in myriads
from their homes, and fill the air with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
food (themselves) which serves to fatten the
<i>really</i> wise, prudent, and industrious Swallows
and Martins, who are skimming through the air
delightedly in search of it. It is true, the Ants
are active enough in providing for their immediate
wants, and artful enough in overcoming
any obstacles to their immediate pleasures. But
all this, and more, the <i>other</i> Aunts, who hold
them up as patterns, will find their little pupils
sufficiently expert in, without any assistance.</p>

<p>Now, we may observe that pretty pair of rural
pictures (not, however, <i>peculiar</i> to this month);
first, when the numerous Flock is driven to fold,
as the day declines,&mdash;its scattered members converging
towards a point as they enter the narrow
opening of their nightly enclosure, which they
gradually fill and settle into, as a shallow stream
runs into a bed that has been prepared for it,
and there settles into a still pool.&mdash;And again, in
the early morning, when the slender barrier that
confines them is removed, they crowd and hurry
out at it,&mdash;gently intercepting each other; and
as they get free, pour forth their white fleeces
over the open field, as a lake that has broken its
bank pours its waters over the adjoining land:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
in each case, the bells and meek voices of the
patient people making music as they move, and
the Shepherd standing carelessly by (leaning on
his crook, even as shepherds did in Arcady itself!)
and leaving the care of all to his half-reasoning
dog.</p>

<p>As I have again got my pencil in hand, instead
of my pen, let me not forget to sketch a
copy of that other pretty picture, at once so still
and yet so lively, which may be had this month
for the price of looking at, and than which Paul
Potter himself could not have presented us with
a sweeter: and indeed, but that he was a mere
imitator of Nature, one might almost swear it to
be his, not hers.&mdash;Fore-ground: on one side, a
little shallow pond, with two or three pollard
willows stooping over it; and on the other a low
bank, before which stand as many more pollard
willows, with round trim heads set formally on
their straight pillar-like stems: between all these,
the sunshine lying in bright streaks on the green
ground, and made distinguishable by the straight
shadows thrown by the thick stems of the trees.
Middle distance: a moist meadow, level as a line,
and on it half a dozen cattle; three lying at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
ease, and “chewing the cud of sweet” (not “bitter”)
herbage&mdash;two cropping the same&mdash;and one
lifting up its grave matronly face, and lowing out
into the side distance; while, about the legs of
all of them, a little flock of Wagtails are glancing
in and out merrily, picking up their delicate
meal of invisible insects; and upon the very back
of one of the ruminators, a pert Magpie has
perched himself. Of the extreme distance, half
is occupied by dim-seen willows, of the same
stunted growth with those in front; and the rest
shows indistinctly, and half hidden by trees, a
little village,&mdash;its church spire pointing its silent
finger straight upward, as if bidding us look at a
sky scarcely less calm and sweet than the scene
which it canopies.&mdash;How says the connoisseur?
Is this a picture of Paul Potter’s, or of Nature?
But no matter,&mdash;for they are almost the same.
There is only just enough difference between
them to make us feel (as the possessor of twin
children does) that we are blessed with <i>two</i> instead
of <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>In the Plantation and Flower-garden we must
hardly expect to find much of novelty, after the
profusion of last month. And in fact there are
very few flowers the first appearance of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
can be said to be absolutely <i>peculiar</i> to this
month; most of those hitherto unnamed choosing
to be the medium of a pleasant interchange between
the two months, according as seasons, and
circumstances of soil and planting, may dispose
them. It must be admitted, however (though
I am very loth, even by implication, to dissever
this month from absolute summer), that many
of the flowers which do come forward now are
<i>autumn</i> ones. Conspicuous among those which
first appear in this month, is the stately Holyoak;
a plant whose pretensions are not so generally
admitted as they ought to be, probably on
account of its having, by some strange accident,
lost its character for <i>gentility</i>. Has this (in the
present day) dire misfortune happened to it, because
it condescends to flower in as much splendour
and variety when leaning beside low cottage
porches, or spiring over broken and lichen-grown
palings, as it does in the gardens of the great?
I hope not; for then those who contemn it must
do the same by the vaunted Rose, and the rich
Carnation; for where do <i>they</i> blow better than
in the daisy-bordered flower-beds of the poor?
The only plausible plea which I can discover,
for the reasonableness of banishing from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
choice parterres this most magnificent of all
their inhabitants, is, that its aspiring and oriental
splendour may put to shame the less conspicuous
beauties of Flora’s court. I hope the latter have
not, through envy, been entering into a conspiracy
to fix an ill name upon the Holyoak, and
thus stir up in the hearts of their admirers a dislike
to it, that nothing else is so likely to produce:
for, give even a flower “an ill name,”
and you may as well treat it like a dog at once.
In fact, I do not think that any thing short of
calling it <i>ungenteel</i> could have displaced the
Holyoak from that universal favour with us
which it always acquires during our youth, in
virtue of its being the only flower that we can
distinguish in “garden scenes” on the stage.</p>

<p>As the Holyoak is at present a less <i>petted</i>
flower than any other, perhaps the Passion-flower
(which blows this month) is, of all those
which bear the open air, the most so; and, I
must say, with quite as little reason. In fact,
its virtue lies in its name; which it owes, however,
to its fantastical construction suggesting
certain religious associations, and not to any romantic
or sentimental ones; which latter, when
connected with it, have grown out of its name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
and not its name out of them. If, however,
it has little that is beautiful and flower-like
about it, it has something bizarre and recherchée,
which is well worth examining. But we
examine it as we would a watch or a compass,
and not a flower; which is its great fault. It
is to other flowers, what a Blue-stocking is to
other women.</p>

<p>Among the other flowers that appear now, the
most conspicuous, and most beautiful, is that one
of the Campanulas which shoots up from its
cluster of low leaves one or more tall straight
spires, clustered around from heel to point with
brilliant sky-blue stars, crowding as closely to
each other as those in the milky way,&mdash;till they
look like one continuous rod of blue, or like the
sky-blue ribbons on the mane of a Lord Mayor’s
coach-horse. These are the flowers that you see in
pots, trained into a fan-like shape, till they cover,
with their brilliant galaxy of stars, the whole window
of the snug parlour where sits at her work
the wife of the village apothecary. Of course I
speak of a not less distance from town than a
long day’s journey: any nearer than that, all
flowers but exotics have long since been banished
from parlour windows, as highly ungenteel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
There are a few other very noticeable flowers,
which begin to show themselves to us late in this
month; but as they by rights rank among the
autumn ones, and as I am not willing to admit
that we have as yet arrived even on the confines
of that season, I must consider that they have
chosen to come before their time, and treat
them accordingly.</p>

<p>In the Shrubbery, too, we shall find little of
novelty. We will, therefore, at once pass through
it, and reach the Orchard and Fruit Garden;
merely observing as we go, that the Elder is
beginning to cast a tinge of autumnal purple on
its profuse berries; that those of the Rowan, or
Mountain Ash, are on the point of putting on
their scarlet liveries, which they are to wear all
the winter; and that the Purple Clematis is
heavy with its handsome flowers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Fruit-Garden is never in a more
favourable state for observation than at present;
for most of its produce is sufficiently advanced to
have put on all its beauty, while but little of it
is in a state to disturb: so that there it hangs in
the sight of its satisfied owner&mdash;at once a promise,
and a fulfilment, without the attendant ills of
either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
The inferior fruit, indeed (so at least it is
reckoned with us, though in the East Indies a
plate of Currants is sometimes placed in the
centre of the table, as a Pine-apple is here, and
holds exactly the same relative value in respect to
the rest of the dessert), the Currants and Gooseberries
are now in perfection, and those epicures
from the nursery, who alone condescend to eat
them in their natural state, may now be turned
loose among them with impunity. A few of the
Apples, too, are now asking to be plucked;
namely, the pretty little, tender, and pale-faced
Jeannotin (vulgaricè <i>Gennettin</i>); the rude-shaped,
but firm, sweet, and rosy-cheeked Codling; and
the cool, crisp, and refreshing Nonsuch,&mdash;eating,
when at its best, like a glass of Apple-ice; and
with a shape and make which entitles it to be
called the very Apollo of Apples.</p>

<p>The Cherries, too, have most of them acquired
their “cherry-cheeks,” and are looking down
temptation</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Unto the white upturned wond’ring eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of <i>school-boys</i>, that fall back to gaze on them,”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as they hang over the garden-wall, next to the
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
As to the other fruits, they look almost as
handsome and inviting as ever they will. But
we must be content to let them “enjoy the air
they breathe” for a month or so longer, if we
expect them to do the same by us.</p>

<p>Of London what shall we say, at this only one
of its seasons when it has nothing to say for itself?
when even the most immoveable of its citizens
become migratory for at least a month, and
permit their wives and daughters to play the
parts of mermaids on the shores of Margate,
while they themselves pore over the evening
papers all the morning, and over the morning
ones all the evening?&mdash;when ’Change Alley
makes a transfer of half its (live) stock every
Saturday to the Steine at Brighton, to be returnable
by Snow’s coaches on Monday morning?&mdash;nay,
when even the lawyers’ clerks themselves
begin to grow romantic, and, neglecting their
accustomed evening haunts at the Cock in Fleet-street,
Offley’s, and the Cider Cellar, permit
themselves to be steamed down from Billingsgate
to Broadstairs, where they meditate moonlight
sonnets to their absent Seraphinas (not without
an eye to half-a-guinea each in the magazines),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
beginning with “Oh, come unto these yellow
sands!”</p>

<p>What <i>can</i> be said of the Town at a time like
this? The truth is, I am not disposed to quarrel
with London (any more than I am with my
“bread and butter,” and for a similar reason) at
any season; so that the less I say or think of it
now the better. Suffice it, that London in August
is a species of nonentity, to all but those
amateur architects who “go partnerships” in
candle-lit grottos at the corners of courts. But,
<i>en revanche</i>, it is to them a month that, like May
to the chimney-sweepers, “only comes once a
year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SEPTEMBER" id="SEPTEMBER"></a>SEPTEMBER.</h2>

<p>I am sorry to mention it, but the truth must
be told, even in a matter of age. The Year,
then, is on the wane. It is “declining into the
vale” of months. It has reached “a certain
age.” Its <i>bloom</i> (that indescribable something
which surpasses and supersedes all mere beauty)
is fled, and with it all its pretensions to be regarded
as an object of passionate admiration.</p>

<p>A truce, then, to our treatment of the Months
as mistresses. But let us henceforth look upon
them as the next best thing, as dear and devoted
friends: for</p>

<p>’Tis true that still</p>

</div></div>

<p>Let me be permitted to make use of a few
more words from the same poem; for by no others
can I hope so well to kindle in the reader, that
feeling with which I would fain have him possessed,
on the advent of this still delightful
season of the year, if it be but received and enjoyed
in the spirit in which it comes to us.</p>

<p>I cannot choose but continue this strain a little
longer; and I suppose my readers will be the
last persons to complain of my doing so; it is
the poet alone who will have cause to object to
his meanings throughout, and in one or two
instances his words, being diverted from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>

application, nor disenchanted of their power.</p>

<p>Reader, this is said by the greatest poet of our
age, and one of the deepest, wisest, and most virtuous
of her philosophic sages. And it is said
by him even in the sense in which it is here
applied, <i>now that it has been once so applied</i>:
for much of his words have this in common with
those of Shakspeare, that you may turn them to
an almost equally apt and good account in many
different ways, besides those in which they were
at first directed. Let them be received, then,
in the spirit in which they are here uttered, and
we shall be able and entitled to continue our
task, of following the year through its vicissi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>tudes,
and still (as we began it) “pursue our
course to the end, rejoicing.”</p>

<p>The youth of the year is gone, then. Even
the vigour and lustihood of its maturity are
quick passing away. It has reached the summit
of the hill, and is not only looking, but descending,
into the valley below. But, unlike that
into which the life of man declines, <i>this</i> is not
a vale of tears; still less does it, like that, lead
to that inevitable bourne, the Kingdom of the
Grave. For though it may be called (I hope
without the semblance of profanation) “The
Valley of the <i>Shadow</i> of Death,” yet of Death
itself it knows nothing. No&mdash;the year steps
onward towards its temporary decay, if not so
rejoicingly, even more majestically and gracefully,
than it does towards its revivification. And
if September is not so bright with promise and
so buoyant with hope as May, it is even more
embued with that spirit of serene repose, in which
the only true, because the only continuous enjoyment
consists. Spring “never <i>is</i>, but always
<i>to be</i> blest;” but September is the month of
consummations&mdash;the fulfiller of all promises&mdash;the
fruition of all hopes&mdash;the era of all completeness.
Let us then turn at once to gaze on, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
partake in, its manifold beauties and blessings,
not let them pass us by, with the empty salutation
of mere praise; for the only panegyric that is
acceptable to Nature is that just appreciation
of her gifts which consists in the full enjoyment
of them.</p>

<p>Supposing ourselves, as usual, in the middle
of the month, we shall find the seed Harvests
quite completed, and even the ground on which
they stood appearing under an entirely new
aspect,&mdash;the Plough having opened, or being
now in the act of opening, its fragrant breast,
and exposing it for a while to the genial influence
of the sun and air, before it is again
called upon to perform its never-failing functions.</p>

<p>There are other Harvests, however, which are
still to be gathered in; in particular, that most
elegant and picturesque of all with which this
country is acquainted, and which may also be
considered as <i>peculiar</i> to this country, upon any
thing like a great scale: I mean the Hop Harvest.
In the few counties in which this plant is
cultivated, we are now presented with the nearest
semblance we can boast, of the Vintages of Italy
and Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
The Apple Harvest, too, of the Cider counties
takes place this month; and though I must not
represent it as very fertile in the elegant and picturesque,
let me not neglect to do justice to its
produce, as the only one deserving the name of
British Wine; all other so-called liquors being,
the reader may rest assured, worse than poisons,
in the exact proportion that specious hypocrites
are worse than open, bold-faced villains.</p>

<p>I hope the good housewives of my country (the
only country in the world which produces the
breed) need not be told, that, in thus placarding
the impostor above-named, I have not the slightest
thought of hurting the high reputation of her
immaculate “home-made,” which she so generously
brings out from the bottom division of
her shining beaufet, and presses (somewhat importunately)
on every morning comer. She shall
never have to ask me twice to taste even a second
glass of it, always provided she calls it by its
true and trustworthy name of “home-made”&mdash;to
which, in <i>my</i> vocabulary, Montepulciano itself
must yield the pas. But if, bitten perhaps
by some London Bagman, she happen to have
contracted an affection for fine phrases, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
chooses to call her cordial by the style and title
of “<i>British wine</i>”&mdash;away with it, for me! I
would not touch it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Though ’twere a draught for Juno when she banquets.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In fact, she might as well call it <i>Cape</i> at once!</p>

<p>The truth is, I once, to oblige an elderly lady
at Hackney, <i>did</i> taste two glasses of “British
wine” at a sitting; and my stomach has had a
load (of sugar of lead) upon its conscience ever
since.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that the general face of
the country has undergone a very material change
for the worse since we left it last month; and
none of its individual features, with the exception
of the Woods and Groves, have improved
in their appearance. The Fields are for
the most part bare, and either black and arid
with the remains of the Harvest that has been
gathered from them, or at best but newly furrowed
by the plough. The ever green Meadows
are indeed still beautiful, and the more so for the
Cattle that now stud them almost every where;
the second crops of grass being long since off.
The Hedge-rows, too, have lost much of their
sweet tapestry of flowers, and even their late
many-tinted greens are sobered down into one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
dull monotonous hue. And the berries and
other wild fruits that the latter part of the season
produces, do not vary this hue,&mdash;having none of
them as yet assumed the colours of their maturity.
It is true the Woodbine again flings
up, here and there, its bunches of pale flowers,
after having ceased to do so for many weeks.
But they have no longer the rich luxuriance of
their Spring bloom, nor even the delicious scent
which belonged to them when the vigour of
youth was upon them. They are the pale and
feeble offspring of the declining life of their
parent.</p>

<p>It follows, from this general absence of wild
flowers, that we are now no longer greeted, on
our morning or evening wanderings, by those
exquisite odours that float about upon the wings
of every Summer wind, and come upon the captivated
sense like strains of unseen music.</p>

<p>Even the Summer birds, both songsters and
others, begin to leave us&mdash;urged thereto by a
prophetic instinct, that will not be disobeyed:
for if they were to consult their <i>feelings</i> merely,
there is no season at which the temperature of
our climate is more delightfully adapted to their
pleasures and their wants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
But let it not be supposed that we have nothing
to compensate for all these losses. The
Woods and Groves, those grandest and most
striking among the general features of the country,
are now, towards the end of the month, beginning
to put on their richest looks. The Firs
are gradually darkening towards their winter
blackness; the Oaks, Limes, Poplars, and Horse-chestnuts,
still retain their darkest summer
green; the Elms and Beeches are changing to
that bright yellow which produces, at a distance,
the effect of patches of sunshine; and the Sycamores
are beginning, here and there, to assume
a brilliant warmth of hue almost amounting to
scarlet. The distant effect, therefore, of a great
company of all these seen together, and intermingled
with each other, is finer than it has
hitherto been, though not equal in beauty and
variety to what it will be about the same time
next month.</p>

<p>But we have some other pretty sights belonging
to the open country, which must not be
passed over; and one which the whole year, in
point of time, and the whole world, in point of
place, can scarcely parallel. The Sunsets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
September in this country are perhaps unrivalled,
for their infinite variety, and their indescribable
beauty. Those of more southern countries may
perhaps match, or even surpass them, for a
certain glowing and unbroken intensity. But for
gorgeous variety of form and colour, exquisite
delicacy of tint and pencilling, and a certain
placid sweetness and tenderness of general effect,
which frequently arises out of a union of the
two latter, there is nothing to be seen like what
we can show in England at this season of the
year. If a painter, who was capable of doing it
to the utmost perfection, were to dare depict on
canvas one out of twenty of the Sunsets that we
frequently have during this month, he would be
laughed at for his pains. And the reason is,
that people judge of pictures by pictures. They
compare Hobbima with Ruysdael, and Ruysdael
with Wynants, and Wynants with Wouvermans,
and Wouvermans with Potter, and Potter with
Cuyp; and then they think the affair can proceed
no farther. And the chances are, that if
you were to show one of the sunsets in question
to a thorough-paced connoisseur in this department
of Fine Art, he would reply, that it was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
beautiful, to be sure, but that he must beg to
doubt whether it was <i>natural</i>, for he had never
seen one like it in any of the old masters!</p>

<p>Another singular sight belonging to this period,
is the occasional showers of gossamer that
fall from the upper regions of the air, and cover
every thing like a veil of woven silver. You
may see them descending through the sunshine,
and glittering and flickering in it, like rays of
another kind of light. Or if you are in time to
observe them before the Sun has dried the dew
from off them in the early morning, they look
like robes of fairy tissue-work, gemmed with
innumerable jewels.</p>

<p>Now, too, Thistle-down, and the beautiful
winged seeds of the Dandelion, float along
through the calm air upon their voyages of
discovery, as if instinct with life.</p>

<p>Now, among the Birds, we have something
like a renewal of the Spring melodies. In particular,
the Thrush and Blackbird, who have
been silent for several weeks, recommence their
songs,&mdash;bidding good bye to the Summer, in the
same subdued tone in which they hailed her
approach.</p>

<p>Finally, in connexion with the open country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
now Wood-owls hoot louder than ever; and the
Lambs bleat shrilly from the hill-side to their
neglectful dams; and the thresher’s Flail is heard
from the unseen barn; and the plough-boy’s
whistle comes through the silent air from the
distant upland; and Snakes leave their last
year’s skins in the brakes&mdash;literally creeping out
at their own mouths; and Acorns drop in showers
from the oaks, at every wind that blows; and
Hazel-nuts ask to be plucked, so invitingly do
they look forth from their green dwellings; and,
lastly, the evenings close in too quickly upon the
walks to which their serene beauty invites us, and
the mornings get chilly, misty, and damp.</p>

<p>Thanks to the art of the cultivator, we shall
find the Garden almost as gay with flowers as it
was last month; for many of those of last month
still remain; and a few, and those among the
most gorgeous that blow, have only just opened.
The chief of these latter is the China-aster;
the superb <i>Reine Marguerite</i>, whose endless variety
of stars shoot up in rich clusters, and glow
like so many lighted catherine-wheels. The great
climbing Convolvulus also hangs out its beautiful
cups among its smooth and clustering leaves;
and the rich aromatic Scabious lifts up its glow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>ing
purple flowers on their lithe stems; and the
profuse Dahlia, that beautiful novelty, which
was till so lately almost unknown to us, scatters
about its rich double and single blooms, some of
them so intense in colour that they seem to <i>glow</i>
as you look upon them. And lastly, now the
pendulous Amaranth hangs its gentle head despondingly,
and tells its tender tale almost as
pathetically as the poem to which it gives a
name<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the flowering Shrubs, too, we have
now some of the most beautiful at their best. In
particular, the Althea Frutex, and the Arbutus,
or Strawberry-tree.</p>

<p>As for the Fruit Garden, <i>that</i> is one scene
of tempting profusion. Against the wall, the
Grapes have put on that transparent look which
indicates their complete ripeness, and have dressed
their cheeks in that delicate bloom which enables
them to bear away the bell of beauty from all
their rivals.&mdash;The Peaches and Nectarines have
become fragrant, and the whole wall where they
hang is “musical with bees.”&mdash;Along the Espaliers,
the rosy-cheeked Apples look out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
among their leaves, like laughing children peeping
at each other through screens of foliage;
and the young standards bend their straggling
boughs to the earth with the weight of their
produce.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Quitting the Country, we shall find London
but ill qualified to compensate us for the losses
we have sustained there; and if there be any
reason in betaking oneself to places at the seaside,
that are neither London nor the Country, now is
the time to do it&mdash;as the citizens of London, and
the liberties thereof, know full well. Accordingly,
now the mansions in Finsbury and Devonshire
Squares on the East, and Queen and
Russell on the West, are changed for mouse-traps
(miscalled marine villas); and the tradesman
who does not send his wife and family to
wash themselves in sea-water cannot be doing
well in the world. Now, therefore, the Brighton
boarding-houses bask in the sunshine of city
favour, always provided their drawing-rooms
look upon the sea; and if you pass them on a
warm afternoon about five o’clock, you may see
their dining-room windows wide open, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
inmates acting a picturesque passage in one of
Mr. Wordsworth’s pastorals:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“There are forty feeding like one.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But if the citizens (because they cannot help
it) permit their wives and daughters to be in
their glory, <i>out</i> of London at this period, they
permit their apprentices, for the same reason, to
be so <i>in</i> it: for now arrives that Saturnalia of
nondescript noise and nonconformity, Bartlemy
Fair;&mdash;when that Prince of peace-officers, the
Lord Mayor, changes his sword of state into a
sixpenny trumpet, and becomes the Lord of Misrule
and the patron of pickpockets; and Lady
Holland’s name leads an unlettered mob instead of
a lettered one; when Mr. Richardson maintains,
during three whole days and a half, a managerial
supremacy that must be not a little enviable even
in the eyes of Mr. Elliston himself; and Mr.
Gyngell holds, during the same period, a scarcely
less distinguished station as the Apollo of servant-maids;
when “the incomparable (not to
say <i>eternal</i>) <i>young</i> Master Saunders” rides on
horseback to the admiration of all beholders,
in the person of his eldest son; and when
all the giants in the land, and the dwarfs too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
make a general muster, and each proves to be,
according to the most correct measurement, at
least a foot taller or shorter than any other in the
fair, and, in fact, the only one worth seeing,&mdash;“all
the rest being impostors!” In short, when
every booth in the fair combines in itself the
attractions of all the rest, and so perplexes with
its irresistible merit the rapt imagination of the
half-holiday schoolboys who have got but sixpence
to spend upon the whole, that they eye
the outsides of each in a state of pleasing despair,
till their leave of absence is expired twice
over, and then return home filled with visions of
giants and gingerbread-nuts, and dream all night
long of what they have <i>not</i> seen.</p>

<p><i>Au reste</i>, London must needs be but a sorry
place in September, when even its substantial
shopkeepers are ashamed to be seen in it, and
when a careful porter may, if he pleases, carry
a load on his head from Saint Paul’s to the
Mansion House, without damaging the heads of
more than half a dozen pedestrians.</p>

<p>As for the West End at this period, it looks
like a model of itself, seen through a magnifying
glass&mdash;every thing is so sad, silent, and empty
of life. The vacant windows look blank at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
other across the way; the doors and their
knockers are no more at variance; the porters
sleep away the heavy hours in their easy chairs,
leaving the rings to be answered from the area;
and if you want to cross the street, you look
both ways first, for fear of being run over&mdash;thinking,
from the absolute stillness, that the
stones of the pavement have been put to silence
by the art-magic of Mr. Macadam.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this, the Winter
Theatres, having permitted their Summer rivals
to play to empty benches for nearly three months,
now put in their claim to share this pleasing
privilege, lest it should be supposed that they
too cannot afford to lose a hundred pounds a
night as well as their inferiors. Accordingly,
every body can have orders now (except those
who ask for them); and the pit is the only place
for those who are above sitting on the same
bench with their boot-maker.</p>

<p>Let us not forget to add, that there is <i>one</i>
part of London which is never out of season,
and is never more <i>in</i> season than now. Covent
Garden Market is still the Garden of Gardens;
and as there is not a month in all the year in
which it does not contrive to belie something or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
other that has been said in the foregoing pages,
as to the particular season of certain flowers,
fruits, &amp;c. so now it offers the flowers and the
fruits of every season united. How it becomes
possessed of all these, I shall not pretend to say:
but thus much I am bound to add by way of
information,&mdash;that those ladies and gentlemen
who have country houses in the neighbourhood
of Clapham Common or Camberwell Grove, may
now have the pleasure of eating the best fruit
out of their own Gardens&mdash;provided they choose
to pay the price of it in Covent Garden Market!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="OCTOBER" id="OCTOBER"></a>OCTOBER.</h2>

<p>They tell us, in regard to this voyage of
ours, called Human Life, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hope travels through, nor leaves us till we die.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But they might have gone still farther, and
shown us that Hope is not only our companion
on the journey, but at once the vehicle which
bears us along, the food which supports us as
we go, and the goal to which all our travels
tend, not merely in the great voyage of discovery
itself, but in all the little outlets and byeways
which break in upon and diversify it.</p>

<p>Even in regard to the objects of external nature,
Hope is the great principle on which we
take any thing like a continuous moral interest
in the contemplation of them; and if we never
cease to feel that interest during all the different
periods of the year, it is because hope is no
sooner lost in fruition, than, like the Phœnix, it
revives again, and keeps fluttering on before us,
like the beautiful Green Bird before the lover, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
the fairy tale; leading us&mdash;no matter where, so
that it do not leave us to plod on by ourselves,
through a world that, however beautiful <i>with</i> it,
were without it an overpeopled wilderness.</p>

<p>The month that we have just left behind us
was indeed one made up, for the most part, of
consummations; the promises of the year being
almost forgotten in the fulness of their performance,
and the season standing still to enjoy
itself, and to let its admirers satiate themselves
upon the rich completeness of its charms. It is
now gone; and October is come; and Hope is
come with it; and the general impulse that we
feel is, to <i>look forward</i> again, as we have done
from the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that the hopes
of <i>this</i> month, in particular, are not unblended
with that sentiment of melancholy&mdash;gentle and
genial, but still melancholy&mdash;which results from
the constant presence of decay. The year has
reached its grand climacteric, and is fast falling
“into the sere, the yellow leaf.” Every day a
flower drops from out the wreath that binds its
brow&mdash;not to be renewed. Every hour the Sun
looks more and more askance upon it, and the
winds, those Summer flatterers, come to it less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
fawningly. Every breath shakes down showers
of its leafy attire, leaving it gradually barer and
barer, for the blasts of winter to blow through it.
Every morning and evening takes away from it
a portion of that light which gives beauty to its
life, and chills it more and more into that torpor
which at length constitutes its temporary death.
And yet October is beautiful still, no less “for
what it gives than what it takes away;” and
even for what it gives during the very act of
taking away.</p>

<p>Let us begin our observations with an example
of the latter. The whole year cannot produce
a sight fraught with more rich and harmonious
beauty than that which the Woods and Groves
present during this month, notwithstanding, or
rather in consequence of, the daily decay of their
summer attire; and at no other season can any
given spot of landscape be seen to much advantage
as a mere picture. This, therefore, is,
above all others, the month for the artist to ply
his delightful task, of fixing the fugitive beauties
of the scene; which, however, he must do
quickly, for they fade away, day by day, as
he looks upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
And yet, if it were represented faithfully, an
extensive plantation of Forest Trees now presents
a variety of colours and of tints that would
scarcely be considered as <i>natural</i> in a picture,
any more than many of the Sunsets of September
would. Among those trees which retain their
green hues, the Fir tribe are the principal; and
these, spiring up among the deciduous ones, now
differ from them no less in colour than they
do in form. The Alders, too, and the Poplars,
Limes, and Horse-chestnuts, are still green,&mdash;the
hues of their leaves not undergoing much
change as long as they remain on the branches.
Most of the other Forest Trees have put on
each its peculiar livery; the Planes and Sycamores
presenting every variety of tinge, from
bright yellow to brilliant red; the Elms being,
for the most part, of a rich sunny umber, varying
according to the age of the tree and the
circumstances of its soil, &amp;c.; the Beeches having
deepened into a warm glowing brown, which the
young ones will retain all the winter, and till the
new spring leaves push the present ones off;
the Oaks varying from a dull dusky green to a
deep russet, according to their ages; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
Spanish Chestnuts, with their noble embowering
heads, glowing like clouds of gold.</p>

<p>As for the Hedge-rows this month, they still
retain all their effect as part of a general and
distant view; and when looked at more closely,
though they have lost nearly all their flowers,
the various fruits that are spread out upon them
for the winter food of the birds, make them little
less gay than they were in Spring and Summer.
The most conspicuous of these are the red hips
of the Wild Rose; the dark purple bunches of
the luxuriant Blackberry; the brilliant scarlet
and green berries of the Nightshade; the wintry-looking
fruit of the Hawthorn; the blue Sloes,
covered with their soft tempting-looking bloom;
the dull bunches of the Woodbine; and the
sparkling Holly-berries.</p>

<p>We may also still, by seeking for them, find
a few flowers scattered about beneath the Hedge-rows,
and the dry Banks that skirt the Woods,
and even in the Woods themselves, peeping up
meekly from among the crowds of newly fallen
leaves. The prettiest of these is the Primrose,
which now blows a second time. But two or
three of the Persicaria tribe are still in flower,
and also some of the Goosefoots. And even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
elegant and fragile Heathbell, or Harebell, has
not yet quite disappeared; while some of the
ground flowers that have passed away have left
in their place strange evidences of their late presence;
in particular, the singular flower (if it
can be called one) of the Arums, or Lords and
Ladies, has changed into an upright bunch, or
long cluster, of red berries, starting up from out
the ground on a single stiff stem, and looking
almost like the flower of a Hyacinth.</p>

<p>The open Fields during this month, though
they are bereaved of much of their actual beauty
and variety, present sights that are as agreeable
to the eye, and even more stirring to the imagination,
than those which have passed away. The
Husbandman is now ploughing up the arable
land, and putting into it the seeds that are to
produce the next year’s crops; and there are
not, among rural occupations, two more pleasant
to look upon than these: the latter, in particular,
is one that, while it gives perfect satisfaction
to the eye as a mere picture, awakens
and fills the imagination with the prospective
views which it opens.</p>

<p>Another very lively rural sight, on account of
the many hands that it employs at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
time, men, women, and children, is the general
Potato gathering of this month.</p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous events of October,
one of the most striking and curious is the interchange
which seems to take place between our
country, and the more northern as well as the
more southern ones in regard to the Birds.
The Swallow tribe now all quit us; the Swift
disappeared wholly, more than a month ago;
and now the House Swallow, House Martin,
and Bank or Sand Martin, after congregating
for awhile in vast flocks about the banks of
rivers and other waters, are seen no more as
general frequenters of the air. And if one or
two <i>are</i> seen during the warm days that sometimes
occur for the next two or three weeks,
they are to be looked upon as strangers and
wanderers; and the sight of them, which has
hitherto been so pleasant, becomes altogether
different in its effect: it gives one a feeling of
desolateness, such as we experience on meeting
a poor shivering Lascar in our winter streets.</p>

<p>In exchange for this tribe of truly Summer
visitors, we have now great flocks of the Fieldfares
and Redwings come back to us; and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
Wood Pigeons, Snipes, Woodcocks, and several
of the numerous tribe of Water-fowl.</p>

<p>Now, occasionally, we may observe the singular
effects of a mist, coming gradually on, and
wrapping in its dusky cloak a whole landscape
that was, the moment before, clear and bright as
in a Spring morning. The vapour rises visibly
(from the face of a distant river perhaps) like
steam from a boiling caldron; and climbing up
into the blue air as it advances, rolls wreath over
wreath till it reaches the spot on which you are
standing; and then, seeming to hurry past you,
its edges, which have hitherto been distinctly
defined, become no longer visible, and the whole
scene of beauty, which a few moments before
surrounded you, is as it were wrapt from your
sight like an unreal vision of the air, and you
seem (and in fact <i>are</i>) transferred into the bosom
of a cloud.</p>

<p>Drawing towards the home scene, we find the
Orchard by no means devoid of interest this
month. The Apples are among the last to shed
their leaves; so that they retain them yet; and
in some cases of late fruit, they retain that too,&mdash;looking
as bright and tempting as ever it did.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
The Cherry-trees, too, are more beautiful at this
time than ever they have been since their brief
period of blossoming, on account of the brilliant
scarlet which their leaves assume,&mdash;varying, however,
from that colour all the way through the
warm ones, up to the bright yellow. There are
also two species of the Plum, the Purple and the
White Damson, which have only now reached
their maturity.</p>

<p>The Elders, that frequently skirt the Orchard,
or form part of its bounding hedge, are also now
loaded with their broad outspread bunches of
purple and white berries, and instantly call up
(to those who are lucky enough to possess such
an association at all) that ideal of old English
snugness and comfort, the farm-house chimney
corner, on a cold winter’s Saturday night; with
the jug of hot Elder-wine on the red brick
hearth; the embers crackling and blazing; the
toasted bread, and the long-stemmed glasses on
the two-flapped oak table; and the happy ruddy
faces of the young ones around, looking expectantly
towards the comely and portly dame
for their weekly <i>treat</i>.</p>

<p>The gentle (query <i>genteel</i>) reader will be
good enough to remember that I am now speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>ing
of old times; that is to say, twenty years
ago; and will not suppose me ignorant enough
to imagine that <i>they</i> can possibly know what I
mean either by “<i>Elder-wine</i>,” or a “<i>chimney
corner</i>.” But though the merits of mulled claret,
an ottoman, and a hearth-rug, shall never be
called in question by me, I must be excused for
remembering that there <i>was</i> a time when I knew
no better than the above, and that I have not
grown wise enough to cease sighing for the return
of that time ever since it has passed away.
Accordingly, though I would on no account be
supposed to permit Elder-wine to pass my actual
palate, I could not resist the above occasion of
tasting it once more in imagination; and I must
say, that the flavour of it is quite as agreeable as
it was before claret became a common-place.</p>

<p>Now is the time for performing another of
those praiseworthy operations which modern refinement
has driven almost out of fashion. I
mean the brewing of Beer that is to be called,
<i>par excellence</i>, “October,” some ten or fifteen
years hence, when it is worth drinking. Country
folks brew as usual, it is true; because the drink
which is sent them down by the London dealers
is what they cannot comprehend: but it has be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>come
a regular monthly work; bearing, however,
about the same relation to those of the good old
times which have passed away, as the innumerable
“twopenny trash” of the present day do to the
good old “Gentleman’s Magazine” that they
have almost superseded. Brewing, nowadays,
(thanks to Mr. Cobbet’s Cottage Economy) is an
affair of a tea-kettle, a washing-tub, and a currant-wine
cask; and “October,” now, will scarcely
keep till November.</p>

<p>Now, the Hives are despoiled of their honey;
and by one of those sad necessities attendant on
artificial life, the hitherto happy and industrious
collectors of it are rewarded with death for their
pains.</p>

<p>It is not till this month that we usually experience
the Equinoxial Gales, those fatal visitations
which may now be looked upon as the
immediate heralds of the coming on of Winter;
as in the Spring they were the sure signs of its
having passed away. Bitter-sweet is it, now, to
lie awake at night, and listen wilfully (as if we
would not let them escape us) to the fierce howlings
of the winds, each accession of which gives
new vividness to the vision of some tall ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
illumined by every flash of lightning&mdash;illumined,
but not rendered <i>visible</i>&mdash;for there are no eyes
within a hundred leagues to look upon it; and
crowded with human beings&mdash;(not “souls” only,
as the sea-phrase is, for then it were pastime&mdash;but
<i>bodies</i>) every one of which sees, in imagination,
its own grave a thousand fathom deep beneath
the dark waters that roar around, and feels
itself there beforehand.</p>

<p>Returning to the home enclosures, we shall
find them far from destitute of attraction; and
indeed if they have been properly attended to,
with a view to that almost unceasing succession
of which the various objects of cultivation admit,
we shall scarcely as yet perceive any of the ravages
which the mere approach of Winter has
already made among their uncultivated kindred.</p>

<p>In the Flower Garden, if much of the beauty
of Summer has now passed away, its place has
been supplied by that which affords one of the
pleasantest employments of the lover of gardening;
for those who do not grow and collect their
own seeds know but half the pleasures of that
most delightful of all merely physical occupations.
The principal flower seeds come to per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>fection
this month, and are now to be gathered
and laid by, before they scatter themselves abroad
at random.</p>

<p>Now, too, is the time for employing another
and an equally fertile and interesting mode of
propagation; that by means of offsets, suckers,
cuttings, partings, &amp;c. Now, in short, most of
the fibrous-rooted perennial plants (regardless of
Mr. Malthus’s principles of population) put forth
more offspring than the ground which they occupy
can support; and unless the Government
under which they live were to provide them with
due means of colonization, they would presently
over-run and destroy each other, until the whole
kingdom, which now belongs to them jointly, became
the exclusive property and possession of
some one powerful but worthless family among
them: as we see on lands that are left to themselves,
and suffered to lie waste: whatever variety
of plants may spring up spontaneously upon
them during the first season or two, at the end
of three or four years all is one unbroken expanse
of rank unproductive grass.</p>

<p>It may be a childish pleasure, perhaps, but it
is a very unequivocal and a very innocent one, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
bid the perennial plants “increase and multiply,”
and to see how aptly and willingly they obey the
mandate. Making plants by this means is a pleasant
substitute for making money, to those who
have none of the latter to begin with. Indeed
I question whether a dozen money-bags, made
out of one, ever yet afforded the maker half the
real satisfaction that a dozen Daisies have done,
multiplied in a similar manner. Not that I can
pretend to judge by experience of the comparative
merits of these multiplication tables; and I
am liberal enough to be willing to give the former
a fair trial, on the very first opportunity that
offers itself.</p>

<p>But though most of the Garden plants are
now busily employed in disseminating themselves
by seeds and offsets, many of them are
still wearing their merely ornamental attire, and
looking about them for admiration as if they
were made for nothing else. If the arrangements
of the borders have been attended to with
a properly prospective eye, they still present us
with several of the Amaranths, and particularly
the everlasting ones; with some of the finest Dahlias;
the great climbing Convolvolus; French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
and African Marigolds, which have now increased
to almost the size of flowering shrubs;
Scabious; China-Asters; Golden-rod; the interminable
Stocks; and, running about among
them all, and flowering almost as profusely and as
prettily as ever, sweet-breathing Mignonette.</p>

<p>Among the Shrubs, too, there are still some
whose flowers continue to look the coming Winter
in the face. In particular, the Arbutus is in
all its beauty,&mdash;hanging forth, like the Orange,
its flowers, fruit, and leaves, all at once. The
Ivy, too, is covered with its unassuming blossoms,
which are as rich in honey as they are
poor in show, and are rifled of their sweets by the
all-wooing bees, with even more avidity than the
fantastical Passion-flower, or the flaunting Rose.</p>

<p>It is a little singular that the most gorgeous
show which the Garden presents during the
whole year should occur at this late period of the
season, and without the intervention of flowers.
I allude to the splendid foliage of the Great
Virginian Creeper, which may now be seen hanging
out its scarlet banners against some high
battlement, or wreathing them into gay and
graceful tapestry about the mouldering walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
of some old watch-tower, or, still more appropriately,
fringing and festooning the embayed
windows of some secluded building, sacred to the
silence of study and contemplation. If I remember
rightly, some beautiful examples of it,
under the latter character, may be seen in two
or three of the inner quadrangles both of Oxford
and Cambridge.</p>

<p>Finally, now, that at once wildest and tamest
of birds, most social and most solitary, the Robin,
first begins to place its trust in man; flitting
about the feet of the Gardener, as he turns up
the freshened earth, and taking its food almost
from the spade as it moves in his hand; or
standing at a little distance from him among the
fallen leaves, and singing plaintively, as if practising
beforehand the dirge of the departing year.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>October is to London what April is to the
Country; it is the Spring of the London Summer,
when the hopes of the shopkeeper begin to bud
forth, and he lays aside the insupportable labour
of having nothing to do, for the delightful leisure
of preparing to be in a perpetual bustle. During
the last month or two he has been strenuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
endeavouring to persuade himself that the Steyne
at Brighton is as healthy as Bond-street; the
<i>pavé</i> of Pall Mall no more picturesque than
the Pantiles of Tunbridge Wells; and winning
a prize at one-card-loo at Margate as piquant a
process as serving a customer to the same amount
of profit. But now that the time is returned
when “business” must again be attended to,
he discards with contempt all such mischievous
heresies, and re-embraces the only orthodox faith
of a London shopkeeper&mdash;that London and his
shop are the true “beauteous and sublime” of
human life. In fact, “now is the winter of his
discontent” (that is to say, what other people call
Summer) “made glorious Summer” by the near
approach of Winter; and all the wit he is master
of is put in requisition, to devise the means of
proving that every thing he has offered to “his
friends the public,” up to this particular period,
has become worse than obsolete. Accordingly,
now are those poets of the shopkeepers, the investors
of patterns, “perplexed in the extreme;”
since, unless they can produce a something which
shall necessarily supersede all their previous productions,
their occupation’s gone.</p>

<p>It is the same with all other caterers for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
public taste; even the literary ones. Mr. Elliston,
“ever anxious to contribute to the amusement
of his liberal patrons, the public,” is already
busied in sowing the seeds of a New
Tragedy, two Operatic Romances, three Grand
Romantic Melodrames, and half a dozen Farces,
in the fertile soil of those <i>poets</i> whom he employs
in each of these departments respectively; while
each of the London publishers is projecting a
new “periodical,” to appear on the first of January
next; that which he started on the first of
<i>last</i> January having, of course, died of old age
ere this!</p>

<p>As to the external appearance of London this
month, the East End of it shows symptoms of
reviving animation, after the two months’ trance
which the absence of its citizens had cast over it;
and Cheapside, though it cannot boast of being
absolutely impassable, is sufficiently crowded to
create hopes in its inhabitants that it soon
will be.</p>

<p>But the West End is as melancholy as the
want of that which ever makes it otherwise can
render it: for the fashionables, though it is more
than a month since they retired from the fatiguing
activity of a London Winter in July, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
the still more fatiguing repose of an October
Summer in the Country, pertinaciously refuse
themselves permission to return to the lesser evil
of the two, till they have partaken of the greater
to such a degree of repletion as to make them
fancy, when the former is on the point of being
restored to them, that it is none at all; thus
making each re-act upon the other, until, to their
enfeebled and diseased imaginations, “nothing
is but what is not;” and being in London, they
sigh for the Country; and in the Country, for
London.</p>

<p>But has London no one positive merit in October,
then? Yes; one it has, which half redeems
all its delinquencies. In October, Fires have
fairly gained possession of their places, and even
greet us on coming down to breakfast in the
morning. Of all the discomforts of that most
comfortless period of the London year which is
neither winter nor summer, the most unequivocal
is that of its being too cold to be without a fire,
and not cold enough to have one. At a season
of this kind, to enter an English sitting-room,
the very ideal of snugness and comfort in all
other respects, but with a great gaping hiatus in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
one side of it, which makes it look like a pleasant
face deprived of its best feature, is not to be
thought of without feeling chilly. And as to
filling up the deficiency by a set of polished fire-irons,
standing sentry beside a pile of dead coals
imprisoned behind a row of glittering bars,&mdash;this,
instead of mending the matter, makes it worse;
inasmuch as it is better to look into an empty
coffin, than to see the dead face of a friend in it.
At the season in question, especially in the
evening, one feels in a perpetual perplexity, whether
to go out or stay at home; sit down or walk
about; read, write, cast accounts, or call for the
candle and go to bed. But let the fire be lighted,
and all uncertainty is at an end, and we (or even
<i>one</i>) may do any or all of these with equal satisfaction.
In short, light but the fire, and you
bring the Winter in at once; and what are twenty
Summers, with all their sunshine (when they are
gone), to one Winter, with its indoor sunshine of
a sea-coal fire?</p>

<p>Henceforth, then, be Winter my theme; and
if I do not grow warm in its praise, it shall not
be for want of inditing that praise beside as
pleasant a fire as nubbly Wall’s Ends, a register-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>stove
(not a Cobbett’s-Register one, I am sorry

<h2><a name="NOVEMBER" id="NOVEMBER"></a>NOVEMBER.</h2>

<p>Of the twin maxims, which bid us to “Welcome
the coming, speed the going guest,” the
latter is better appreciated than practised. The
over refinements of modern life make people
afraid of giving in to it, who yet feel it to be an
excellent one. The truth is, that when a guest,
of no matter how agreeable a presence, or how
attractive an air, has made up his mind to go,
the sooner he goes the better. Let him go at
once, therefore. Do not press him to stay, or
detain him at the door, but “speed” him on his
way. It is best for both parties, if they like
each other. When, indeed, an unpleasant intruder
is about to depart, there is a kind of
satisfaction in detaining him a little. We dally
with the prospective pleasure of having him gone,
till we forget that he is present. But when those
we love are leaving us, the best way is, to wink,
and part at once; for to be “going” is even
worse than to be “gone.”</p>

<p>Thus let it be, then, with that delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
annual guest, the Summer (under the agreeable
alias of Autumn), in whose presence we have
lately been luxuriating. We might perhaps, by
a little gentle violence, prevail upon her to stay
with us for a brief space longer; or might at
least prevail upon ourselves to believe that she
is not quite gone. But we shall do better by
speeding her on her way to other climes, and
welcoming “the coming guest,” gray-haired
Winter. So be it, then.</p>

<p>The last storm of Autumn, or the first of
Winter, call it which you will, has strewed the
bosom of the all-receiving earth with the few
leaves that were still clinging, though dead, to
the already sapless branches; and now all stand
bare at once,&mdash;spreading out their innumerable
ramifications against the cold, gray sky, as if
sketched there for a study, by the pencil of your
only successful drawing-mistress&mdash;Nature. Of
all the numerous changes that are perpetually
taking place in the general appearance of rural
scenery during the year, there is none so striking
as this which is attendant on the falling of the
leaves; and there is none in which the unpleasing
effects so greatly predominate over the pleasing
ones. To say truth, a Grove, denuded of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
late gorgeous attire, and instead of bowing majestically
before the winds, standing erect and
motionless while they are blowing through it, is
“a sorry sight,” and one upon which we will
not dwell. But even this sad consequence of the
coming on of Winter, sad in most of its mere
visible effects, is not entirely without redeeming
accompaniments; for in most cases it lays open
to our view objects that we are glad to see again,
if it be but in virtue of their association with
past years; and in many cases it opens vistas
into sweet distances that we had almost forgotten,
and brings into view objects that we may
have been sighing for the sight of all the Summer
long. Suppose, for example, that the summer
view from the windows of a favourite sleeping-room
is bounded by a screen of shrubs, shelving
upward from the turf, and terminating in a little
copse of Limes, Beeches, and Sycamores&mdash;the
prettiest boundary that can greet the morning
glance, when the shutters are opened, and the
Sun slants gaily in at them, as if glad to be
again admitted. How pleasant is it,&mdash;when, as
now, the winds of Winter have stripped the
branches that thus bound our view in,&mdash;to spy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
beyond them, as if through net-work, the sky-pointing
spire of the distant village church,
rising from behind the old Yew-tree that darkens
its portal; and the trim parsonage beside it,
its ivy-grown windows glittering perhaps in the
early sun! Oh&mdash;none, but those who <i>will</i> see
the good that is in everything, know how very
few evils there are without some of it attendant
on them.</p>

<p>But though the least pleasant sight connected
with the coming on of Winter in this month is,
to see the leaves, that have so gladdened the
groves all the Summer long, falling everywhere
around us, withered and dead,&mdash;that sight is
accompanied by another which is too often overlooked.
Though most of the leaves fall in Winter,
and the stems and branches which they
beautified stand bare, many of them remain all
the year round, and look brighter and fresher
now than they did in Spring, in virtue of the
contrasts that are everywhere about them. Indeed
the cultivation of Evergreens has become
so general with us of late years, that the home
enclosures about our country dwellings, from the
proudest down to even the poorest, are seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
to be seen without a plentiful supply, which we
now, in this month, first begin to observe, and
acknowledge the value of. It must be a poor
plot of garden-ground indeed that does not now
boast its clumps of Winter-blowing Laurestinus;
its trim Holly-bushes, bright with their scarlet
berries; or its tall Spruce Firs, shooting up their
pyramid of feathery branches beside the low,
ivy-grown porch.</p>

<p>Of this last-named profuse ornamenter of whatever
is permitted to afford it support (the Ivy),
we now too everywhere perceive the beautifully
picturesque effects: though there is one effect of
it, also perceived about this time, which I cannot
persuade myself to be reconciled to: I mean
where the trunk of a tall tree is bound about
with Ivy almost to its top, which during the
Summer has scarcely been distinguished as a
separate growth, but which now, when the other
leaves are fallen, and the outspread branches
stand bare, offers to the eye, not a contrast, but
a contradiction.</p>

<p>But let us not dwell on any thing in disfavour
of Ivy,&mdash;which is one of the prime boasts of the
village scenery of our island, and which, even at
this season of the year, offers pictures to the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
that cannot be paralleled elsewhere. Perhaps
as a single object of sight, there is nothing
which gives so much innocent pleasure to so
many persons, as an English Village Church,
when the Ivy has held undisputed possession of
it for many years, and has hung its fantastic
banners all about it. There is a charm about
an object of this kind, which it is as difficult
to resist as to explain the secret of. <i>We</i> will
attempt neither; but instead, continue our desultory
observations.</p>

<p>Now, as the branches become bare, another
sight presents itself, which, trifling as it is, fixes
the attention of all who see it, and causes a
sensation equally difficult with the above satisfactorily
to explain. I mean the Birds’ nests
that are seen here and there in the now transparent
hedges, bushes, and copses. It is not difficult
to conceive why this sight should make
the heart of the schoolboy leap with an imaginative
joy, as it brings before his eyes visions of
five blue eggs lying sweetly beside each other,
on a bed of moss and feathers; or as many
gaping bills lifting themselves from out what
seems one callow body. But we are, unhappily,
not all schoolboys; and it is to be hoped not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
many of us ever <i>have been</i> bird-nesting ones.
And yet we all look upon this sight with a
momentary interest, that few other so indifferent
objects are capable of exciting. The wise may
condescend to explain this interest, if they please,
or if they can. But if they do, it will be for their
own satisfaction, not ours, who are content to be
pleased, without insisting on penetrating into the
cause of our pleasure.</p>

<p>Now, the felling of Wood for the winter store
commences; and, in a mild still day, the measured
strokes of the Woodman’s axe, heard far
away in the thick Forest, bring with their sound
an associated feeling, similar to that produced by
a wreath of smoke rising from out the same
scene: they tell us a tale of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Uncertain dwellers in the pathless Woods.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The “busy flail,” too, which is now in full employment,
fills the air about the homestead with
a pleasant sound, and invites the passer by to
look in at the great open doors of the Barn, and
see the Wheatstack reaching to the roof on either
hand; the little pyramid of bright Grain behind
the Threshers; the scattered ears between them,
leaping and rustling beneath their fast-falling
strokes; and the flail itself flying harmless round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
the Labourers’ heads, though seeming to threaten
danger at every turn; while, outside, the flock
of “barn-door” Poultry ply their ceaseless search
for food, among the knee-deep straw; and the
Cattle, all their summer frolics forgotten, stand
ruminating beside the half-empty Hay-rack, or
lean with inquiring faces over the gate that looks
down into the Village, or away towards the distant
Pastures.</p>

<p>Of the Birds that have hitherto made merry
even at the approach of Winter, now all are
silent; all save that one who now earns his title
of “the Household Bird,” by haunting the
thresholds and window-cills, and casting sidelong
glances indoors, as if to reconnoitre the
positions of all within, before the pinching frosts
force him to lay aside his fears, and flit in and
out silently, like a winged spirit. All are now
silent except him; but <i>he</i>, as he sits on the
pointed palings beside the doorway, or on the
topmost twig of the little Black Thorn that has
been left growing in the otherwise closely-clipt
Hedge, pipes plaintive ditties with a low <i>inward</i>
voice,&mdash;like that of a love-tainted maiden, as she
sits apart from her companions, and sings soft
melodies to herself, almost without knowing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
Some of the other small Birds that winter
with us, but have hitherto kept aloof from our
dwellings, now approach them, and mope about
among the House-sparrows, on the bare branches,
wondering what has become of all the leaves, and
not knowing one tree from another. Of these
the chief are, the Hedge-sparrow, the Blue Titmouse,
and the Linnet. These also, together
with the Goldfinch, Thrush, Blackbird, &amp;c. may
still be seen rifling the hip and haw grown
hedges of their scanty fruit. Almost all, however,
even of those Singing-birds that do not
migrate, except the Redbreast, Wren, Hedge-sparrow,
and Titmouse, disappear shortly after
the commencement of this month, and go no one
knows whither. But the pert House-sparrow
keeps possession of the Garden and Court-yard
all the Winter; and the different species of
Wagtails may be seen busily haunting the clear
cold Spring-heads, and wading into the unfrozen
water in search of their delicate food, consisting
of insects in the <i>aurelia</i> state.</p>

<p>Now, the Farmer finishes all his out-of-door
work before the frosts set in, and lays by his
implements till the awakening of Spring calls
him to his hand-labour again.</p>

<p>Now, the Sheep, all their other more natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
food failing, begin to be penned on patches of
the Turnip-field, where they first devour the
green tops joyfully, and then gradually hollow
out the juicy root,&mdash;holding it firm with their
feet, till nothing is left but the dry brown husk.</p>

<p>Now, the Herds stand all day long hanging
their disconsolate heads beside the leafless Hedges,
and waiting as anxiously, but as patiently too,
to be called home to the hay-fed Stall, as they
do in Summer to be driven afield.</p>

<p>Now, (for they will not be overlooked or forgotten,
do what we will to dwell on other things),
now come the true disagreeables of a Winter in
the Country; and perhaps at no other time are
they so determinate in making themselves felt,
or is it so difficult to escape from them. And
yet what are they after all, (<i>i. e.</i> after they are
over) but wholesome bitters thrown occasionally
into the cup of life, to keep the appetite in health,
and give a true tone to those powers of enjoyment,
upon which the luxuries of Summer would
pall, if they were not frequently to pass away in
fact, and exist only in fancy? We may talk as
much as we will about the perpetual blue skies
of Southern Italy, and enjoy them, if we please,
in imagination. And we may even <i>wish</i> for them
here, without any great harm, provided we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
content to do without them. But no Englishman,
who was at once a lover of external Nature,
and an attentive observer of her effects on his
own heart and mind, ever, by absolute choice,
determined to live away from his own variable
climate, even <i>before</i> he had tried that of other
countries, still less after. Even if there were
nothing else to keep him at home, he would
never consent to part with the perpetual <i>green</i>
of his native Fields, in exchange for that perpetual
<i>blue</i> with which it cannot coexist: and
this, if for no other reason, because green is
naturally a more grateful colour to the eye than
blue. But, in fact, to those who have the means
of enjoying all that England has the means of
offering for enjoyment, its climate is the best
in the world; and it is even that which, upon
the whole, gives rise to the greatest number of
beautiful natural appearances. We boast, not
without reason, of our unrivalled skill in gardening,
and our taste in taking advantage of the
natural beauties of picturesque scenery. But
we claim too much credit for ourselves, and give
too little to our climate, for the creation of this
taste. If we had lived under Italian or French
skies, our Gardens and Pleasure-grounds would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
have been Italian or French. Where can the
Sunsets and Sunrisings of England be equalled
in various beauty? But that beauty depends, in
a great measure, on her mists, clouds, and exhalations.
The countries of clear skies and unbroken
sunshine scarcely know what a Rainbow
is: and yet what pageant of the earth, the air,
or the water, is like it? In short, the climate
of England, like her people, is the best in the
world; and what is more, the latter are the best
precisely <i>because</i> the former is. And that this
can be said with perfect sincerity, in the heart of
the country during the heart of November, is a
proof, not to be gainsaid, that the joint proposition
is true.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may now safely return to my duty,
of depicting the several unamiable aspects which
the face of November is apt to assume; and
which, in my lover-like disposition to “see Helen’s
beauty in a brow of Egypt,” I had serious
thoughts of either passing over altogether, or
denying the existence of outright!</p>

<p>Now, then (there is no denying it), cold rains
do come deluging down, till the drenched ground,
the dripping trees, the pouring eaves, and the
torn ragged-skirted clouds, seemingly dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
downward slantwise by the threads of dusky
rain that descend from them, are all mingled
together in one blind confusion; while the few
Cattle that are left in the open Pastures, forgetful
of their till now interminable business of
feeding, turn their backs upon the besieging
storm, and hanging down their heads till their
noses almost touch the ground, stand out in
the middle of the Fields motionless, like dead
images.</p>

<p>Now, too, a single rain-storm, like the above,
breaks up all the paths and ways at once, and
makes home no longer “home” to those who are
not obliged to leave it; while, <i>en revanche</i>, it
becomes doubly endeared to those who are. What
sight, for instance, is so pleasant to the wearied
Woodman, who has been out all day long in the
drenching rains of this month, as his own distant
cottage window, seen through the thickening
dusk, lighted up by the blazing faggot that is to
greet his sure return at the accustomed minute?
What, I say, is so pleasant a sight as this, except
the window of the village alehouse, similarly seen,
and offering a similar greeting, to him who has
<i>no</i> home?</p>

<p>The name of home warns us that we are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
long delaying our approach to its environs, even
though they have little to offer us different from
the comparative desolation that prevails elsewhere.</p>

<p>In short, the Fruits of the Orchard are all
gathered in, and all but the keeping ones are
gone; and the Flowers of the Garden are gradually
growing thinner and thinner, and the
places where they lately stood are forgotten.</p>

<p>Still, however, of the former we have the
Winter store, laid by in fragrant heaps in the
low-roofed loft over the Granary; and of the
latter we have yet left some that scatter their
till now neglected beauties up and down the
half-deserted Parterre, and gain that admiration
by their rarity, which in the presence of their
more fleeting rivals they were fain to do without;
and even a few that have not ventured to show
their faces to the hot sun of Summer, but are bold
enough to bare them before the chilling winds
of Winter. Of these the most various and conspicuous
are the Chrysanthemums, shooting out
their sharp rays of different lengths, like stars&mdash;purple,
and pink, and white, and yellow, and
blue; but all pale, faint, and scentless, and looking
more like artificial flowers than real ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
Some of the rich Dahlias, too, still remain,
unless the killing frosts have come; and the
Geraniums, that have been turned out of their
winter homes into the open earth, still keep
flowering profusely. But a single night’s frost
makes sad havoc among both these bright ornaments
of the Autumn Flower-garden; and what
is to-day a rich cluster of green leaves, interspersed
with gay groups of flowers, may to-morrow
become, by an invisible agency, an unsightly
heap of corruption.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>London is so perfect an antithesis to the
Country in all things, that whatever is good for
the one is bad for the other. Accordingly, as
the Country half forgets itself this month, so
London just begins to know itself again. Not
that I would insinuate any thing so injurious to
the reputation of the high fashionables, as that
they have as yet began to entertain the remotest
thought of throwing themselves into the arms of
one another, merely because they have become
wearied of themselves. On the contrary, persons
of fashion are perpetual martyrs to the selfdenying
principles on which they act, of doing every
thing for or with a reference to other people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
Every body knows, that if there <i>is</i> a month of
the year in which the Country puts forth less
claims than usual to the undivided love of her
admirers, it is November. But people of fashion
never yet pretended either to love or admire any
thing&mdash;even themselves;&mdash;any thing but that
abstraction of abstractions from which they take
their title. Accordingly, to them the Country
is as much the Country in November as ever it
was, simply because London is not yet London.
In short, to be in London, is to be <i>in the world</i>;
and to be in the Country, or any where else but
in London, is to be <i>out of the world</i>; and therefore,
to say that one is “in the Country,” when
it is not decorous to be in London, is a mere
<i>façon de parler</i>, exactly equivalent to that of
“not at home,” when one does not choose to be
seen; so that there is no difficulty whatever in
being “in town” all the year round, and yet
“out of town,” exactly when it is proper and
becoming to be so.</p>

<p>But if the world of fashion belongs exclusively
to London, luckily London does not belong exclusively
to the world of fashion; and if that has
not yet began to enlighten London with its presence,
all the other worlds have. Accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
now its streets revive from their late suspended
animation, and are alive with anxious faces, and
musical with the mingled sounds of many wheels.</p>

<p>Now, the Shops begin to shine out with their
new Winter wares; though as yet the chief profits
of their owners depend on disposing of the
“Summer stock” at fifty per cent. under prime
cost.</p>

<p>Now, the Theatres, admonished by their no
longer empty benches, try which shall be the
first to break through that hollow truce on the
strength of which they have hitherto been acting
only on alternate nights.</p>

<p>Now, during the first week, the citizens see
visions and dream dreams, the burthens of which
are Barons of Beef; and the first eight days are
passed in a state of pleasing perplexity, touching
their chance of a ticket for the Lord Mayor’s
Dinner on the ninth.</p>

<p>Now, all the little boys give thanks in their
secret hearts to Guy Faux, for having attempted
to burn “the Parliament” with “Gunpowder,
treason, and plot,” since the said attempt gives
them occasion to burn every thing they can lay
their hands on,&mdash;their own fingers included: a
bonfire being, in the eyes of an English school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>boy,
the true “beauteous and sublime of human
life.”</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;now the atmosphere of London begins
to thicken overhead, and assume its <i>natural</i>
appearance&mdash;preparatory to its becoming, about
Christmas time, that “palpable obscure” which
is one of its proudest boasts; and which, among
its other merits, may reckon that of engendering
those far-famed Fogs of which everybody has
heard, but to which no one has ever done justice.
A London Fog in November is a thing for which
I have a sort of natural affection;&mdash;to say nothing
of an acquired one, the result of a Hackney-coach
adventure, in which the fair part of the
fare threw herself into my arms for protection,
amidst the pleasing horrors of an overthrow.&mdash;As
an affair of mere breath, there is something
tangible in a London Fog. In the evanescent
air of Italy, a man might as well not breathe at
all, for any thing he knows of the matter. But
in a well-mixed Metropolitan Fog there is something
substantial, and satisfying. You can feel
what you breathe, and see it too. It is like
breathing water,&mdash;as we may fancy the fishes to
do. And then the taste of it, when dashed with
a due seasoning of sea-coal smoke, is far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
insipid. It is also meat and drink at the same
time; something between egg-flip and omelette
soufflée, but much more digestible than either.
Not that I would recommend it medicinally,&mdash;especially
to persons of queasy stomachs, delicate
nerves, and afflicted with bile. But for
persons of a good robust habit of body, and not
dainty withal&mdash;(which such, by the by, never
are)&mdash;there is nothing better in its way. And it
wraps you all round like a cloak, too&mdash;a patent
water-proof one, which no rain ever penetrated.</p>

<p>No&mdash;I maintain that a real London Fog is a
thing not to be sneezed at&mdash;if you can help it.</p>

<p><i>Mem.</i> As many spurious imitations of the
above are abroad,&mdash;such as Scotch Mists, and
the like&mdash;which are no less deleterious than disagreeable,&mdash;please
to ask for the “True London
Particular,” as manufactured by Thames, Coal-gas,
Smoke, Steam, and Co. No others are
genuine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="DECEMBER" id="DECEMBER"></a>DECEMBER.</h2>

<p>My pleasant task approaches to its pleasant
close; for it is pleasant to approach the close of
<i>any</i> task&mdash;even a pleasant one. The beautiful
Spring is almost forgotten in the anticipation of
that which is to come. The bright Summer is
no more thought of, than is the glow of the
morning sunshine at night-fall. The rich Autumn
only just lingers on the memory, as the
last red rays of its evenings do when they have
but just quitted the eye. And Winter is once
more closing his cloud-canopy over all things,
and breathing forth that sleep-compelling breath
which is to wrap all in a temporary oblivion, no
less essential to their healthful existence than is
the active vitality which it for a while supersedes.</p>

<p>Of the mere external appearances and operations
of Nature I shall have comparatively little
to say in connexion with this month, because
many of the former have been anticipated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
January, while the latter is for the most part a
negation throughout the whole realms of animate
as well as inanimate nature.</p>

<p>The Meadows are still green&mdash;almost as green
as in the Spring, with the late-sprouted grass
that the last rains have called up, since it has
been fed off, and the Cattle called home to enjoy
their winter fodder. The Corn-fields, too, are
bright with their delicate sprinkling of young
autumn-sown Wheat; the ground about the
Hedge-rows, and in the young Copses, is still
pleasant to look upon, from the sobered green of
the hardy Primrose and Violet, whose clumps of
unfading leaves brave the utmost rigour of the
season; and every here and there a bush of
Holly darts up its pyramid of shining leaves and
brilliant berries, from amidst the late wild and
wandering, but now faded and forlorn company
of Woodbines and Eglantines, which have all the
rest of the year been exulting over and almost
hiding it, with their quick-growing branches and
flaunting flowers. The Evergreens, too, that
assist in forming the home enclosures, have altogether
lost that sombre hue which they have
until lately worn&mdash;sombre in comparison with
the bright freshness of Spring and the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
variety of Autumn; and now, that not a leaf
is left around them, they look as gay by the
contrast as they lately looked grave.</p>

<p>Now, the high-piled Turnip cart is seen labouring
along the narrow lanes, or stands ready with
its white load in the open field, waiting to be
borne to the expectant Cattle that are safely
stalled and sheltered for the season; while, for
the few that are still permitted to remain at the
mercy of the inclement skies, and to make their
unwholesome bed upon the drenched earth, the
moveable Hay-rack is daily filled with its fragrant
store, and the open shed but poorly supplies
the place of the warm and well-roofed stalls
of the Straw-yard.</p>

<p>Now, too, some of the younger members of
the herd (for the old ones know by experience
that it is not worth the trouble), seeing the
tempting green of the next field through the
leafless Hedge-rows, break their way through,
and find the fare as bitter and as scanty as that
which they have left.</p>

<p>Now, the Hazels throw out their husky blossoms
from their bare branches,&mdash;looking, as they
hang straight down, like a dark rain arrested in
its descent; and the Furze flings out its bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
yellow flowers upon the otherwise bare common,
like little gleams of sunshine; and the Moles
ply their mischievous night-work in the dry
meadows; and the green Plover “whistles o’er
the lea;” and the Snipes haunt the marshy
grounds; and the Wag-tails twinkle about near
the spring-heads; and the Larks get together
in companies, and talk to each other, instead
of singing to themselves; and the Thrush occasionally
puts forth a plaintive note, as if half
afraid of the sound of his own voice; and the
Hedge-sparrow and Titmouse try to sing; and
the Robin does sing still, even more delightfully
than he has done during all the rest of the year,
because it now seems as if he sang for us rather
than for himself&mdash;or rather <i>to</i> us, for it is still
for his supper that he sings, and therefore for
himself.</p>

<p>There is no place so desolate as the Orchard
this month; for none of the fruit-trees have any
beauty <i>as trees</i>, at their best; and now, they have
not a leaf left to cover their unsightly nakedness.</p>

<p>Not so with the Kitchen Garden; <i>that</i>, if it
has been duly attended to, is full of interest
this month,&mdash;especially by comparison with the
scenes of decay and barrenness by which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
surrounded. The Fruit Trees on the walls are all
nailed out with the most scrupulous regularity;
and by them, as much as by any thing else, may
you now judge of the skill and assiduity of your
gardener. Indeed this is of all others the month
in which <i>his</i> merits are put to the test, and in which
they often seem to vie with those of Nature herself.
Anybody may have a handsome garden
from May to September; but only those who
deserve one can have it from September to May.
Now, then, the walls are all covered with their
wide-spread fruit fans; the Celery beds stretch
out their unbroken lines of fresh-looking green;
the late-planted Lettuces look trim and erect
upon the sheltered borders where they are to
stand the Winter, and be ready, not to open,
but to shut up their young hearts at the first
warm breath of Spring; the green strings of
autumn-sown Peas scarcely lift their tender
downward-turning stems above the dark soil;
the hardy Endives spread out their now full-grown
heads of fantastically curled leaves, or
stand tied up from the sun and air, doing the
penance necessary to acquire for them that agreeable
state of unhealthiness without which (like
modern fine ladies who contrive to blanch them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>selves
in a similar manner, and by similar means)
our squeamish appetites could not relish them;
the Cauliflower, Brocoli, and Kale plants, maintain
their unbroken ranks; and, finally, even
the Cabbages themselves (Mr. Brummel being
self-banished to Boulogne, and therefore not
within hearing, I may venture to say it), even
the young Cabbages themselves contrive to look
genteel, in virtue of their as yet heartless state;
which is, in fact, the secret of all gentility,
whether in a Cabbage or a Countess.</p>

<p>As to the Flower-garden this month, it looks
a picture either of pleasantness or of poverty,
according to the degree of care and skill which
has been bestowed upon it; for though Nature
wills that we shall enjoy her beauties during a
certain period of the year, whether we use any
efforts towards the obtaining them or not, yet
she lays it down as a general principle, in regard
to her gifts, that to seek them, is at once to deserve,
to have, and to enjoy them; and that without
such seeking, we shall only have just enough
to make us sigh after more. Accordingly, her
sun shines with equal warmth upon the Gardens
of the just and the unjust; and her rains fertilise
the Fields of all alike. In short, as it is with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
the loveliest of her works, Woman, her favours
are to be obtained by assiduous seeking alone;
her love is the reward, not of riches, nor beauty,
nor power, nor even of virtue, but of love alone.
No man ever gave a woman his entire love, and
sought hers in return, that he did not, to a certain
extent, obtain it; and no man ever paid similar
court to Nature, and came away empty handed.</p>

<p>But we are wandering from the Garden;
which should not be, even at this least attractive
of all its seasons; for though the honours which
it offers to the close of the year cannot vie with
those which it scatters so profusely about the
footsteps of the Spring, we shall find them full
of interest and beauty, where we find them at all.</p>

<p>Now, then, if the frosts have not set in,
the Garden contains, or ought to contain, a numerous
variety of the Chinese Chrysanthemums,
which resemble and take the place of the more
glaring, but less delicately constructed China-asters.
The most beautiful of these is the Snow-white,
looking, with its radii of different lengths,
like a lighted catherine-wheel. To have these
in any perfection, however, their growth must
have been a little retarded by art; for their
natural time of blowing is during the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
month. But it must be remembered, that the
Winter Garden is an affair of Art assisted by
Nature, rather than of Nature assisted by Art.
So that I doubt, after all, whether I shall not
be overstepping the path I had marked out for
myself, in describing what a Winter Garden <i>may
be</i>. As this is what I would, above all things,
avoid, let me at once refrain from pointing out
any thing but what <i>must</i> be found in my prototype,
Nature, under ordinary circumstances;
for I would rather omit from my portraits much
of what their originals do contain, than introduce
into them any thing that they do not. And, even
with this restriction, we shall find the Garden
replete with pleasant objects.</p>

<p>The Annuals, even the latest blowing, have all
been rooted up, and their straggling stems cleared
away; all, except perhaps a few lingering Marigolds,
and some clumps of Mignonette, that will
go on blowing till the frost cuts them off. The
Geraniums that were turned into the open ground
in the Autumn, to fill up the vacancies left by the
falling off of the early annuals, are still in flower,
always provided there has not yet been a night’s
sharp frost: if there has, they have all withered
beneath its (to them) baleful influence, as if by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
magic. The same may be said of the Dahlias,
with this difference,&mdash;that the destruction of
their luxuriant upper and visible growth is but
the renewal of the vigorous vitality that lies hid
for a season in their self-generating roots.</p>

<p>Now, the Monthly, or China Rose, begins to
be again appreciated. It has been flowering all
the Summer long for its own peculiar satisfaction,
and almost unnoticed amidst the flush
of fresher looking beauty that surrounded it.
But now, its pale blossoms, with their faint perfume,
are the favourites of the Garden; and a
whole company of them, wreathing about a low
trellised porch, make a momentary Summer in
the most wintry of scenes.</p>

<p>Finally, now, every here and there, start up
those stray gifts which have “no business” to
be seen at this season, but which, like fragments
of blue sky scattered among black overhanging
clouds, remind us of the beautiful whole to which
they belong. I mean the little precocious Primroses,
Snowdrops, &amp;c. that sometimes during
this month find, or rather lose, their way from
their Winter homes, where they ought now to
be hiding, and peep up with their pale faces, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
if in search of that Spring which they will now
never see.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If there is no denying that the Country is at
its worst during this much abused month, it
must be conceded, in return, that London is at
its best: for at what other time is it so difficult
and disagreeable to get along the streets? and
when are they so perfumed with the peculiar
odour of their own mud, and is their atmosphere
so rich in the various “choice compounds” with
which it always abounds?</p>

<p>But even these are far from being the prime
merits of the Metropolis, at this season of its best
Saturnalia. The little boys from school have
again taken undisputed possession of all its pleasant
places; and the loud laughter of unchecked
joy once more explodes on spots from whence,
with these exceptions, it has long since been
exploded. In short, Christmas, which has been
“coming” all the year (like a waiter at an inn),
is at last actually come; and “merry England”
is, for a little while, no longer a phrase of mockery
and scorn.</p>

<p>The truth is, we English have fewer faults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
than any other people on earth; and even among
those which we have, our worst enemies will not
impute to us an idle and insane levity of deportment.
We still for the most part, as we did five
hundred years ago, <i>nous amusons tristement,
sêlon l’usage de notre pays</i>. We do our pleasures,
as we do our duties, with grave faces and
solemn airs, and disport ourselves in a manner
becoming our notions of the dignity of human
nature. We feel at the theatre as if it were a
church, and consequently at church as if it were
a theatre. Our processions to a rout move at the
same rate as those to a funeral, and there are,
in proportion, as many sincere mourners at the
former as the latter. We dance on the same
principle as that on which our soldiers do the
manual exercise; and there is as much (and as
little) of impulse in the one as the other. And
we fight on the same principle as we dance;
namely, because circumstances require it of us.</p>

<p>All this is true of us under ordinary circumstances.
But the arrival of Christmas-time is
<i>not</i> an ordinary circumstance; and therefore <i>now</i>
it is none of it true. We are merry-makers
once more, and feel that we can now afford to
play the fool for a week, since we have so re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>ligiously
persisted in playing the philosopher
during all the rest of the year. Be it expressly
understood, however, by all those “surrounding
nations” who may happen to meet with this
candid confession of our weakness in the above
particular, that we permit ourselves to fall into
it in favour of our children alone. They (poor
things!) being as yet at so pitiable a distance
from “years of discretion,” cannot be supposed
to have achieved the enviable discovery, that
happiness is a thing utterly beneath the attention
of a reasoning and reasonable being. Accordingly,
they know no medium between happiness
and misery; and when they are not enjoying
the one, they are suffering the other.</p>

<p>But that English parents, generally speaking,
love their children better than themselves, is
another national merit which I must claim for
them. The consequence of this is natural and
necessary, and brings us safely round to the
point from which we started: an English father
and mother, rather than their offspring should
not be happy at Christmas-time, will consent to
be happy at that time themselves! It does not
last long; and surely a week or so spent in a
state of foolish felicity may hope to be expiated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
by a whole year of unimpeachable indifference!
This, then, is the secret of the Christmas holiday-making,
among the “better sort” of English
families,&mdash;as they are pleased somewhat invidiously
to call themselves.</p>

<p>Now, then (to resume our details), “the raven
down” of metropolitan darkness is “smoothed”
every midnight “till it smiles,” by that pleasant
relic of past times, “the waits;” which wake us
with their low wild music mingling with the
ceaseless sealike sound of the streets; or (still
better) lull us to sleep with the same; or (best
of all) make us dream of music all night long,
without waking us at all.</p>

<p>Now, too, the Bellman plies his more profitable
but less pleasant parallel with the above;
nightly urging his “masters and mistresses” to
the practice of every virtue under heaven, and
in his own mind prospectively including them
all in the pious act of adding an extra sixpence
to his accustomed stipend.</p>

<p>Now, during the first week, the Theatres
having begun to prepare “the Grand Christmas
Pantomime, which has been in active preparation
all the Summer,” the Carpenter for the time
being, among other ingenious changes which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
contemplates, looks forward with the most lively
satisfaction to that which is to metamorphose <i>him</i>
(in the play-bills at least) into a “machinist;”
while, pending the said preparations, even the
“Stars” of the Company are “shorn of their
beams” (at least in making their transit through
that part of their hemisphere which is included
behind the scenes), and all things give way before
the march of that monstrous medley of “inexplicable
dumb show and noise,” which is to delight
the Galleries and Dress-circle, and horrify
the more <i>genteel</i> portion of the audience, for the
next nine weeks.</p>

<p>Finally, now occur, just before Christmas,
those exhibitions which are peculiar to England
in the nineteenth century; I mean the Prize-Cattle
Shows. “Extremes meet;” and accordingly,
one of the most unequivocal evidences we
have to offer, of the surpassing refinement of the
age in which we live, consists in these displays
of the most surpassing grossness. The alleged
<i>beauty</i> of these unhappy victims of their own
appetites acting with a view to ours, consists in
their being unable to perform a single function
of their nature, or enjoy a single moment of their
lives; and the value of the meat that they make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
is in exact proportion to the degree in which it
is <i>un</i>fit to be eaten.</p>

<p>To describe the joys and jollifications attendant
on Christmas, is what my confined limits
would counsel me not to attempt, even if they
were describable matters. But, in fact, there
is nothing which affords such truly “lenten
entertainment” as a feast at secondhand: the
Barmecide’s dishes were fattening by comparison
with it. In conclusion, therefore, let me say that I
shall think it very hard, if the gentle readers of
these pen and ink sketches of the Months have
not been persuaded, during the perusal of each,
that I have fulfilled my promise made at the
commencement, of proving each, in its turn, to
be better than all the rest. At any rate, if they
are not so persuaded, they must, to be consistent,
henceforth abandon all pretended <i>admiration</i>,&mdash;which
is an affair of impulse, not of judgment,&mdash;and
must proceed to <i>compute</i> the value of every
thing that comes before them, according to its
comparative value in regard to some other thing.
In short, they must at once adopt Horace’s hateful
worldly-minded maxim of “nil admirari”
&amp;c. as rendered still more hateful and worldly-minded
by Bolingbroke and Pope’s version of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
it; and must “make up their minds,” as the
mechanical phrase is, that not merely “not to
<i>wonder</i>,” (which is what Horace meant, if he
meant any thing) but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Not to <i>admire</i>, is all the art <i>they</i> know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make men happy, and to keep them so.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, in truth, as it is only for the satisfaction of
living friends and lovers that people sit for their
portraits; not to gratify the spleen of cavilling
critics, nor even to convey their effigies to a
posterity that will not care a penny about them;
so it is only to please the friends and lovers of
Nature, that I have painted the merely natural
portion of these “pictures in little” of the
Months.</p>

<p>As to the artificial portions,&mdash;being of no
use to any one else, the posterity of a twelve-month
hence is welcome to them, as records of
the manners of the day, caught, not “<i>living</i> as
they <i>rise</i>,” but dying as they fall: for in the
gardens of Fashion and Folly there are happily
no perennials; and though the plants which grow
there for the most part belong to that species
which have winged seeds, and therefore disperse
themselves to wheresoever the winds of heaven
blow, the same provision causes them to escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
from the spot where they sprang up, and make
way for those which the chances and changes of
the season may have deposited there. Thus
each plant in turn has its day; and each parterre
has an annual opportunity of priding itself upon
an exhibition of specimens, which last year it
would have laughed at, and which next year it
will despise. And “thus runs the world (of
Fashion) away.”</p>

<p>But not so with the world of Nature. Here,
all as surely returns as it passes away; and
whatever is true in these papers in regard to
that, will be true of it while time shall last.
Wishing my readers, therefore, “many happy
returns of the <i>present</i> season” (meaning whichever
it may happen to be during which they
are favouring these light leaves with a perusal),
let me conclude by counselling such of them (if
any there be) as have hitherto failed to appreciate
and enjoy the good that is every where scattered
about them, not to waste themselves away in
vain regrets over what cannot be recalled, but
hasten to atone to that Nature which they have
neglected, by making the Future repay them for
the Past, until their reckoning of happiness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
even. Of this they may be assured, that it is
rarely if ever too late to do so, and that the
human mind never parts with the power of righting
itself, so long as “the human heart by which
we live” is not wilfully closed against the counsel
which comes to it from all external things.</p>

Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
